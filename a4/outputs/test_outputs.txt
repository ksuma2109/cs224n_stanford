You know that what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you read in the United States.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a epiphany is usually something that fell somewhere else.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school, in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class.
When he was beaten up to bleed every week in the <unk> bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life as I was able to get into the bathroom room.
I did it in <unk>
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
And I had an thumb, 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working on organizations who fight against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night, I got a phone call from that <unk> <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults we never got to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've ever found.
And I have to tell you that I've got pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to talk to you, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we were <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and <unk> and we got rid of her family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was needed.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as adult came to <unk> became a box of cinders and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about was in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today was a lot of this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature, and everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was amazed.
My heart can quickly, was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
The <unk> to me around the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't think this was a <unk> of snow on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they get out of the glaciers or they break the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give up and hold up to the end, whereas others can't get more and <unk> in a passion of passionate <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated <unk> and alone, in large measure as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> I'm breathing out of your atmosphere <unk>
As a <unk> melts it releases fresh water in minerals that feeds a lot of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way, and they won't be going back to exist again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way through the life cycle.
Part of the ice of the <unk> which I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's a bit frequent to actually witness a <unk> <unk>
Here you go.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an iceberg from average size.
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same moment, every single <unk> <unk> OK.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want it to be <unk> too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about understanding in the conception -- I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in one case, the <unk> and sperm joins the chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome is joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity floor to go to two roles.
In one of my roles with the story of anatomy.
I am a <unk> in training, and what I study in this case is the way people started the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how they've considered the body fluids.
The other role to performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients, or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with identical twins, two people within one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much more low than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physics of physics does not fit in the male and female <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having a sex that is not <unk> in common or female forms.
For example, there's the case of the individual <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene of the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> that they become <unk>
And then, in life -- the testes produce testosterone.
But since this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a result, the body develops following a <unk> course.
When you get older, the baby looks like a little girl.
It's a boy, it's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like this.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most of the women like me -- I think I consider a <unk> woman, he doesn't know his <unk> structure, and I believe being a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to <unk> than the woman who was born with testicles who have the <unk> syndrome.
That's why sex is complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old was born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sex with her, he was wearing a life as a kid and he had just figured out he had <unk> and <unk>
It had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had the 20th chromosomes and the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that essentially created a male <unk>
As a result, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical problems that were caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors figured out that, in fact, was a woman on it.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> that they have <unk> tissue wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> or <unk> they are <unk> it is not to be able to even have any better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason they go through many surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity -- being black wants to say to have any African anatomy in terms of <unk>
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture with the <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people within one body.
The highest case is last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> put in the <unk> of his sex <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What do you have to do to determine whether you're <unk> <unk> or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or between men and women and women and women and <unk> we are us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more the science, more we have to admit that these categories are -- we were thinking about these categories of <unk> <unk> categories directly with <unk> categories that are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
In terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do we <unk> in the fact of the <unk> in just a few <unk>
And as we thrive in the science we get more and more in a awkward area where we need to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today <unk> not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors had never had to get it with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose and if he moved on, they still didn't get it.
So if I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract life from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma that is really likely to be somebody's death, and it puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion explosion could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I got a little nervous.
So let's say these categories are much more fragile than we thought about what we thought about it.
<unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find every very much looking at that musical <unk> <unk> and not the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> were, for me, the first activists of anatomy and explain why.
What they were <unk> was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another thing that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
So the monarchs from the old world did not know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was going to be taken by the right of blood passed from grandfather to the father and then the son, and so on.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replacing it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the <unk> differences that was very radical.
And they were part of it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were actually <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power <unk> that was transmitted by it from a Greek idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And at a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future of Rights <unk>
They didn't think of it, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women <unk>
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people of <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the U.S. Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color that are going to make the <unk> <unk> about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> to anatomy.
I don't mean that at the age of five years, they were supposed to have sex with sexual <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk> that I make sense and that I think we should support it.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two transformations at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> two <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, knowing that one of them, <unk> was born three months before <unk> June 1, 1980.
Henry, in the contrary, was born in term: <unk> the March of 1980.
For the only fact that I had been born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to the right for sexual consent.
Henry needs to wait for all of that not because it has a different age, but because it was born afterwards.
We found other people in relation to their rights.
So Henry, at virtue of being considered a man -- if I didn't tell you if it's <unk> to be considered to be considered a man now is <unk> from the ringing of that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
You know the same part, you don't have the same rights for marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So I still have <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that the science went out so much in the field of the anatomy that we got to the point that we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people get stuck in a rare position.
For example: Texas at a moment has decided to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome married and to marry a woman you have to have <unk> Y.
Now in practice they don't do any test tests to people.
But this is also very strange about the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> of <unk>
If you look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I love <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea is very good.
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be involved in this for <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent <unk> smart and <unk> about their sex relationships that people from 40 I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States continues to drive this current of thinking about the subject of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live in, for example, in a context like the Iranian who is being attracted to other men is sensitive to being <unk> unless they are willing to have a change of sex, in which case it allows you to live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm happy to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon that I talked about a couple years ago that I had made up to light twins and then pick them apart and then <unk> his fame.
But when the phone asked the reason for the <unk> operation, a very <unk> operation, he responded to me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum instead of the separation of <unk>
America offers huge possibilities for people to be who are without <unk> to change the same state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to finish up, I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be like or as it might have been, if we had a greater participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and it is that I think there can be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about studies -- is that women, on average, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and dealing with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I was considered <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism is about getting rid of the <unk> of gender, so there's no female <unk>
But the more I thought about the question, the more I think is there is some female <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to the complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the <unk> were very aware of finding the way to protect people by the state, it's possible that, to be more <unk> to this concept, perhaps we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when you make democracy beyond <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and to think more about relationships.
So while we tried to create a more perfect <unk> let's think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work, and have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents to engage new individuals.
Well, we are far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't count a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But they just put together by buildings from apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments were already online, and that the other half is still the absence of doing it.
They could try to increase the ability by making <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you think is that those buildings and the areas that are around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the phase.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But they could go to a whole new place, build a whole new apartment building out there, and when the rules of that place will build the construction instead of <unk>
So I proposed that governments will set up new reform zones big enough to contain cities and gave them a name, under <unk> cities.
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
They knew that every year about 75,000 <unk> they were going out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional crisis.
In the next few regular elections -- the <unk> that we promised you with a platform in which the reforms <unk> reforms and the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests in <unk> I tried to reduce this very complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their <unk> ideas.
The first point was the importance of rules, such as those rules that say that you cannot go and address all the current masters of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like norms for <unk> and usually they are the rules that keep us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They called me to me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So we met in December in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City -- which is worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument and at some point, when there was a <unk> pause, maybe you could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in a very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
This airport is only covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, and we have to start with a site that would <unk> at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said, <unk> <unk> thank you so much for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this was explaining to you that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you might go in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away from the North.
And also new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need the help of countries -- they could benefit from the countries associated with them that help them to establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that they could all trust that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be able to easily catch a thousand square miles.
And little later, the 19 of January, they voted on Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional disposal that would allow to create these special <unk> regions.
In a country I had just gone through this <unk> crisis in Congress to favor this constitutional constitutional was from <unk> to one.
All of the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the Constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed again in another voting in <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting in the aftermath of the 21 to 24 in February, a <unk> <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is building in North Korea, it's bigger than the Boston center.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years went to the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical mode, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and you're thinking about a place for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and at the time it would allow the <unk> to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow her Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and developers in cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know have figured out that they have a good number of residents.
There are many companies that wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change them immediately to another place.
There's a million a year coming from Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go and get a work -- sometimes they are mothers who have to earn money for just to eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it seem to think about <unk> so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank you TED "Thank you TED.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and I was more recently to photograph and publishing in my blog suits and colorful and different for each time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets, and <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to meet people who are usually going to be a good <unk> My mind is <unk> and buying it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
<unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all of the answers are positive, then I feel that I won.
Going back to the topic of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I mean.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear and nothing else.
You see inside for exactly a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that I would be able to find everything else I want to use after I got to Palm <unk>
And because you don't know me like the woman walking for TED in underwear, --  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, or not, I've learned in this journey of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see well.
You almost always see a phenomenal thing for less than 50 dollars.
All of the <unk> including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've been used in a week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a brilliant red pants in it.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- you don't just get <unk> you also love you.
<unk> <unk> of the kid who are coming in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember their little seven years.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's pretty certain you are.
And if you think you're not good with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, you don't look at you not <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth to you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and only is a great way of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and over again, when people were approaching this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously, this is obviously not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, and I'm going to give it out of it.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave certain things.
I don't need to find myself emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> and <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you look at a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical for example.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists, we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them playing with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
You see, intuition that can have developed with the step of the years is that one thing that says one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing on a parking <unk>
It was a little kid and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet that play with that bar <unk> I taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking lot, play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of things that are really weird -- like they can go through walls, or that can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was physics a few years ago -- you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you don't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That's not very well at my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it doesn't get good to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't all follow the principles of <unk>
I don't find the reason why I didn't have.
And so I would feel so much better if I could somehow prove that a common object is also still the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see it's been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just at the center.
And then here is a good approach to the small metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of a metal piece with a springboard a springboard and that <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost in the same way to do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a chip of silicon chip and put all the great machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of swimming swimming that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little bit of aid.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on a elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on a single elevator -- I do all kinds of weird things, but then when you get other people up with doing those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> journey of inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that the <unk> and the wind that goes on to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
And then you put out the lights, then you get a <unk> and we pulled out the air -- and then they would break it into a temperature of less than a degree on absolute zero.
Now, when you're only in the <unk> the little metal piece is <unk> to act like this.
So we measure their movements.
We discovered that moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was <unk> and the way it was <unk> was like a breath of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and that you didn't get it at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you about is really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In an case, all the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
It was worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on a scale between one atom and that little metal piece is more or less the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, and why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logic on the logic of speech.
So imagine if you were in a number of places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put it up, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator actually are just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics is hearing that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so <unk>
It's more profound.
So those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that is here and that allowed me to get it.
It took me 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories, you get it with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is simply explaining to this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education -- I didn't get to me, but I had no access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go at museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better than I show the demo to then to explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've been doing from his launch.
So we're going to go back to <unk>
Look around every museum there.
There's the gallery gallery at MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, by the <unk> the art of art in New York.
There are two ways to do that -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the flat, and one click, we jumped in.
They're inside, that you want to go at the end of the hall,
They go forward. That is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the question <unk>
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all information about <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on this right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you actually get with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see funny things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I came up and discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people, and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a <unk> <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even more deep deeper and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the image, so you'll see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another favorite of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It increases and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night I think I'd never seen this before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are many things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that's the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all of these images.
It's very easy, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just <unk> around.
It's about "The <unk> in the National Gallery.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all of the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to its work of art and it's represented properly online.
And the big question I'm doing today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
So I have something to show you.
Think about it is a <unk> <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm out of <unk> all the children in Italy -- growing up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has been a very interesting thing in racing racing in the last two decades.
So some time ago, if you wanted to win a race of Formula 1, it would take a budget and get it to a good pilot and a good car and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough -- you get the race.
This is what in engineering, it's <unk> control system in real time.
It's basically a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're going to be <unk> <unk>
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
Five percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for weekends at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like almost all the light atoms will get sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end of the hammer, and he threw it into the Moses -- it was actually -- you can actually see a little bit of a dent in <unk> and he said, "Come and said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of capturing the environment and push something on.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years in Italy.
It was a summer.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup of the World.
Perhaps some of the remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I actually won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity of <unk> on the web.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
On the late afternoon, there are people over here, and there are called <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call to the toilet.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, <unk>
That night all went to <unk> at the center.
There's the great summit.
The next day they went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world went down.
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> people go to <unk> is a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today, we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a <unk> how it's <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed a little bit of small tags to track the trash in their system through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year, to tag what they were doing, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a tag <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this data, we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that had not existed before.
They're going on, and there's a lot of <unk> <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we just <unk> that is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that we put on a day still still there.
What if we show that to people, then we can promote some change for <unk>
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology, technology would join that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves are open and <unk>
It creates like a water curtain with water pixels in it.
If you get the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open for us to happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the Mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And <unk> a commission to design the entrance to the entrance to <unk>
We call it <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There are no windows, no windows, but when you find it up, it opens up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind -- if you want to minimize the <unk> the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this one.
Those days there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it's low all of the architecture goes away.
Here it is running.
It looks like people who are going on in the inside.
And here I'm myself myself trying to do not <unk> when the sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was really even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to leave you off, but a building that was still making <unk> and holes and one had to jump to not getting wet.
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, always think about using people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air, and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw earlier, moving with other in sync.
Could we form this cloud, this cloud, like this.
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal or normal, but in three dimensions, where the light changes is not the position of the evening.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appear at different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all that could be a cloud of pixels in the one that you can close, and see it from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> as well as before.
When you turn the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with one input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancing dancers of today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture its 3D movement and use them as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> catch in different <unk>
It's both a real-time real-time 3D motion as a movement.
It can spread all the movement.
You can go through the way.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people in order to do something and change our environment <unk> as a <unk> nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everyone <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we spent the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is we can go through the digital world -- the power of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today -- think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, <unk>
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the evening.
It's a physical structure in London, but cover from the evening.
You can move inside, you have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom of the main Olympics of the 2012 Olympics 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection to the community.
So, it's a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up as a new top of London.
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what they are.
Suppose you told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could better improve it for more accurate and more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you might like to be more strong to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and <unk> of themselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe be those people who are always wanting to be more creative.
What are you going to tell you about it.
What would you like if you could choose something?
<unk> from Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people do creativity?
Raise your hand.
<unk> probably had to be the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you want memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something of this that the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe is that possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> topic here at the TED Conference but I want to give you a doctor of a doctor on the subject.
The great geneticist of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay titled "Nothing in biology makes sense except to the light of the <unk>
But if effectively embrace biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Is the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end is, of course, the most interesting thing.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of precedent.
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we're very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, that comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the gut more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> gives you the <unk> you think about the <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, <unk> is very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that you can want to want to be <unk>
It's really like a quick pathway for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of some hurry to the output.
But by the way, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they're essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what do we <unk> the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something perhaps better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you've got it.
When I just went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two <unk> cells.
But when organisms appear. things start to change.
He goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction.
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the death of the body goes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to <unk> that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death <unk> -- it seemed rather reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still lie in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits your door to hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of it is a little light dancer <unk>
He looks at it and he says, <unk> it for a <unk> <unk>
"Okay, it says, "I said, "I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to be healthy.
I wanted to get health to the disease.
I wanted them to live more and more healthy.
Evolution consists of moving the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all appreciate the feeling that Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my job.
I want to <unk> you not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily benefit longevity.
They don't necessarily favors the largest or the stronger or even the smarter.
Evolution favors the creatures better adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish around the vacuum, yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's going on in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase.
The first one is that you don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us to behave and we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we will feel so much that it's no longer possible to have the necessary isolation for that evolution.
A second possibility is that there is a evolution of the traditional kind of natural kind of natural kind of forces by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when as a kind of <unk> planets are going to be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility -- an amazing possibility -- intriguing and terrifying possibility.
I call it the <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected by us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First of all, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society but it is what you choose and family and familiar.
Just think that if you could be able to choose not only sex in your own body, but in your own body to make genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating the <unk>
Don't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and she's 13.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of having finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a close cost at 20,000 and within a week.
Not a lot to be able to make the human genome for <unk> and be more and more at all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect themselves but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there's not an experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against the flu flu cells in a plant plants.
Can you imagine something good about the <unk>
That's reality today, and in the future it's going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies, but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, eliminating the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same technology is <unk> that very engine of science that can produce changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also embrace <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could get it with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> <unk> that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions of Tweet this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have turned the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can get it to 1,000 years, and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or grandchildren are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these options in a better society, more successful society, more <unk>
Or, we're going to choose to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, more and more robust or more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for wrong, and before what you might have, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk about <unk>
And so they immediately looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably get some <unk>
And the pilot had already cracked the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot had the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the way.
It takes the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and without noises.
And then he said three words ...
The three most <unk> words I've ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight <unk>
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before I die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in and didn't, and I didn't, all the fences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that further, I got a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to know nothing about life.
And that urgency, that purpose, it really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is while <unk> the George Washington, which wasn't a lot -- I thought about, <unk> I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to do everything I did.
But in my humanity I also give up to my ego.
And I'm sorry of time that I think about things that didn't care with people I know matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as a <unk> in that, I decided to get rid of the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental watch goes <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I did, I had the feeling of, <unk> dying is not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to say, "I love my life.
And that sadness would be <unk> in a single thought, which is just desire one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic <unk> --   And I scream, <unk> as a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point I got to connect those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and go back and live differently.
You are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens on your plane -- and please not be like this, but imagine, and how to <unk>
What is it that <unk> that they are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How does their relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents that are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many different projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> of the 1980s.
One day he got home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has total paralysis.
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design design and animation, so obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and I met her brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with it, and he will be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, it's not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> isn't that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're going to be somebody important and you have a very good point you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate <unk>
Somebody seen the movie <unk> and <unk>
They communicate in that way, you get <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I presented to me with the only desire to deliver a check and rather than that signed a check that I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I teamed up with her brother and her father there at the very moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk about, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in your inside can't be able to <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface, and then with a laser pointer -- you draw about that and register the negative space.
So they're going down there making art facilities like this.
All the things that we <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle of life.
They start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, after the Bush attacks and the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of a way to move things from one side to another one we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of insurance companies, and we get a machine that <unk> could make a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's more <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was bringing seven programmers from all over the corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, kids and I, we moved to the garage and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they <unk> would have taken off the frames of the walls and in their place there would be <unk>
But for two weeks <unk> we went to the <unk> and my son was part of my son as part, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> <unk> that we bought at the ride <unk> Beach, some copper wire and things from Home <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We take a camera <unk> we put it on a light of LED light, and there's a device that's free -- and it builds up one <unk> we published the code -- we published the software <unk> the software goes down as free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says <unk>
There's no hospital that can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was amazing.
So at the end of the two weeks, we came back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There were all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming, intense early sessions in all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the hospital parking out of the hospital.
And he came back to drawing for the first time in front of her family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we feel like we were doing graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was saying, "This was the first time that drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and someone finally came to <unk> and they would take me out there so that I could <unk>
Isn't it wonderful?
In some form that is our scream of war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to better and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many prize.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were the <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up with the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> in downtown Los Angeles in downtown Los Angeles in the center of Los Angeles <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of what's in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain moment.
Do you get it, you know, anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with the technology of recognition, I just recognized something, I just recognized something, and I had wonderful people in order to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want us all to do every day when we find something that we feel that we need to do. If it's not now, when? And if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations very hard in situations very difficult and at the same time as much dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
They're going to be able to get it into <unk> areas and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days of eating just a lot fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I have been <unk> in situations in some horrible appearance with the only goal to try to look at social issues in ways that are <unk> <unk> and hopefully analyzing them in a way that can be seen and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I'd come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some of Twitter, offered to sell the rights of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had been the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in the <unk> to you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity to make it.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I hadn't been able to get married for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working, we looked at the world of marketing, <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been standing in some horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be able to <unk> it for something that hard or so dangerous or so dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that tries to deal with the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> of marketing and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The <unk> movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie ever <unk> is that everything on top of the bottom of the end, has <unk> images, all the time; from the <unk> who appears before the title, <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> by the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> It was more by <unk>
He was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X mark in the title but we're going to make sure we're going to take all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe you <unk> a shoe and it goes back to the coolest shoe that you <unk>
The most cool car that you've driven in "The greatest <unk> the best drink that you <unk> <unk> from "The largest movie ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, to make them <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> MS: And actually we showed the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is all transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the full idea -- all the movie, it was beginning to end.
And I would love to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> No <unk> How much money you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to be a meeting with them, but it certainly is going to be worth convincing a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the film is going to be able to see as a lot of <unk> idiots
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> by the film or be I?
JK:
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
So, <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about which brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> when you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: So I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No want to have anything to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to so many people like possible, to make so many people saw it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the <unk> stage is not the idea to have that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to bring the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
Actually no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that were missing.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: The <unk> of simulation or <unk> easily <unk> or easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in practical practices being the last line -- maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our <unk> <unk> President <unk> even CEOs <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to doing something something really changes all of it.
But why? Well, the transparency day --  like that weird bear still still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird way.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want a story, but <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father told me in some lie -- and there he is staring at me as he was looking at me as he said, "Son, there are three sides in history.
There is your story, and it's my story, and it's <unk> history.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my mind, I would have to take out the <unk> and go to the companies I have to go to the companies myself.
So what I started to realize is that I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big big films -- giant <unk> and others who make small films -- independent films like mine.
And my friends who make a big Hollywood Hollywood movies, they say the reason why their films have so much success is because of the brands associated with the markings associated with them.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "You're good for this <unk>
Are you ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you to be <unk>
Maybe you should have a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there is one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a solid, solid, <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a little boy.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are more well a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind people about the reason that we are interested in.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something audacious, cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It's really cool.
How do we keep you fresh longer? We better get more <unk> three times more cool.
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What about me?
I need to talk to the man in the street, to people like me, to ordinary <unk>
They have to talk to me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like a good job.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, lots of gray colors and things like this.
All of the things that I've been trying to do is <unk> or <unk> or I like <unk> and <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand like a <unk> <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2: The brand that I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: It's partly hippie in part of <unk> partly <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
They provide toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> <unk>
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be brand Tom but I often <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they would surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: <unk> a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings to be.
MS: These people shape the way to see the world.
A: <unk> of that world.
MS: That world? I think that your world is the world in which we are looking around like people around you, your friends, the way you live your life, the work you live in.
All of those things come from and start in a place and in my case come from and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to <unk>
MS: The next one is this the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like the different things.
I like things weird -- I like things weird things.
A: <unk> of the <unk> and what does that deal with that?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important? What about <unk>
Let's get a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be fear. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> Thank you.)
A: Thank you for your patience. <unk> Great <unk> A: <unk> Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot crazy about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of that there are two different sides of the <unk> <unk> Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were getting very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I believe that some companies are just going to be engaged in one of their strong points or on the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be -- and this is nature, nature to avoid the things that aren't <unk> they will avoid fear, those elements, and you actually give them a positive thing for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are it?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands now and brands -- those things that have gone and come through -- it's a pretty potent thing.
MS: A <unk> What is your <unk>
If someone asks you to <unk> your branding identity, your <unk> what would be?
Are you a <unk> <unk> You're somebody who makes the blood <unk>
Or are you more well a attribute of it.
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or fearless like <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical as <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
You are conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
Are you a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are reliable, stable, familiar, safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, mostly because they shouldn't be control, you have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they now use magnetic resonance to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing as a movie for film.
We went to San Paulo where they have been forbidden in the open air.
In the entire city over the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> nothing <unk>
And we went to school districts that companies are getting into the schools with problems with money with the U.S. problems.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects that I've had the greatest response or the ones that I've been more successful are those where I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they took their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try and directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do to think of people, who's going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone? They were success?
Well, since the film was sent in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was sent off in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a <unk> period.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to make momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all the agencies that we talk about is <unk> their customers not to be <unk>
I've always believed that if you get <unk> if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you get to the people that are pushing them to failure.
I think when you train their employees at loss of risk is preparing their entire company for reward for rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, we'll go, I think we have to give place to the fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
From one <unk> at the time, we need to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to support transparency.
More than never a little bit of honesty is going to go through a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk, <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data on big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very many people.
June Cohen: So, I put it in behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: That's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check for the TED matrix -- the <unk> Foundation is a check for <unk> to be applied to my assistance for TED <unk>
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest active to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we were able to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> can cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge.
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software is a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective computer virus in a laptop that used for an engineer to set up this gray, and we are smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, <unk> the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> boxes.
That became the attention, and we started an experiment where we infected our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they were very strange.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat who didn't like our <unk> <unk> but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for active in the gray box if it finds a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is effectively working in that location.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say, for example, a U.S. power plant in Germany.
Better than we would get the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two pumps and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed armed with people who obviously had the entire inner information.
They would take all the points for them to attack.
You probably even know how much to do the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech and high-tech -- let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much above all we've seen before.
Here's a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to engage them with the real world, with potential potential to the real world.
We need theories that we need to pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a white <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections have been <unk>
They don't find a number of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went back to an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that cell phone within the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was making it slow and <unk> in an effort to make the nest <unk> so they couldn't solve this very quickly.
We try and figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called <unk>
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
It's almost <unk>
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
And so there's no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been out after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to start.
Yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> would be, to one single goal, but from different perspectives.
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> is communicated with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we looked at me really <unk>
There's the gray, and the top is the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the input values for example, of pressure sensors and sensors of vibration and provides <unk> code -- which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the safety camera feeds <unk>
It's great.
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam steam is at speed, you have to open water valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then they can pass bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> or the security system will be <unk>
That scares it.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> to uranium.
It could work as well, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk> factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have to learn how to disseminate this burden with a key <unk> like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
It was more possible.
And if you look at that, with what you think about is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We need to deal with the consequences and better that we begin to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower behind it.
There's one alone -- and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give it <unk> or another one that makes a <unk> users go back and go back again.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are nothing different from something that gets in the morning, gives you a big force -- that will also increase your speed, and they help, for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the actual integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connected it with the universe and other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we began to talk about the American soldier who, on average, must carry on its back a <unk> payload and it's been <unk> to carry even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- lesions in the back of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from the back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or the <unk> Human Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton -- I can 80 up 90 pounds per variables for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run a big <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the eyes of the <unk> users of what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in the prison chairs around the world.
Like one percent of the full population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with often very often, very young people, with damage to the spinal cord -- that when they start their life -- at 20, 30 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be your only option.
We also talk about the population that makes it very rapidly.
Their only option, many times -- for a brain injury, or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so over the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had an injury in the neocortical column and as a result he couldn't go back over 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors -- it has some sensors.
It's completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals on board, here on the back.
There are some batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it go through this soft <unk>
AB: I was 24 at the top of my life when, for a strange leap in the air, skiing down the bottom was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all of the movement of shattered down.
Little while later, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never come back to <unk>
That happened about 19 years ago.
So I stole it to the last bit of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs in <unk> climbing rocks and ride on the <unk>
But they've never invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the future of future generations -- not just soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of <unk>
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of the Russian Bonobos of the Congo.
<unk> are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living alive.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known to their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much focused on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the Bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> the <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where the mortal violence is still not due to.
But unfortunately, the Bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been likely for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting meat and deforestation is that you can't fill in a stadium with the Bonobos who are in the world -- and honestly, we're not certain about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden in the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like the apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have frequent sex, <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a kid.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of behavior, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo is looking at the roots of your laughter, the same and the dance and the <unk>
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a couple of unique videos just taken out of the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> game game, and I don't talk about soccer.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what is doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> has <unk>
I just believe that in this case to him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common in Bonobos both in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to the game -- like the <unk> and also how play requires trust and promotes the <unk> and at the same time it's more fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> can be able to adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young female female, which is playing with no water <unk>
I think, like her, sometimes we play alone, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that the Bonobo Bonobo gives us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to a world more and more difficult and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of adaptation.
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But <unk> the most of our game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
To Bonobos and humans <unk> it's not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate play, they can be the moments where the most urgent thing is.
And so people primates, to embrace this gift of evolution and play together as <unk> and friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York -- I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of the captain in a <unk> body.
And in our city, where volunteers were going to be highly qualified <unk> you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability of go.
But there was still a career on top of the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner of no doubt on one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before I am, <unk> <unk> <unk> came up to the captain and he asked her to go up and put it into the dog's dog.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people who entered a building in a building to save a live day because he won by five seconds.
Well, I was the next.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need between the house.
I need <unk> <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire firefighters that at the top of that height or less had finished off the fire and went into the fourth room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my charge on the ladder to where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house treasures for home where, as it was to expect, their trove got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the owner of the house <unk> by brave to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at about what else was that someone had reached up even a pair of shoes.
Both on my calling in Robin <unk> as on my calling as firefighter as authentic. I witness acts of generosity and kindness on a logarithmic scale, but also the acts of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look at this room to people who have did, or they are making remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this:
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining hall, a park in the neighborhood.
They are mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So you enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem odd, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks made in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement in a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than we are, like buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
It was called <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> got all the home.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or home.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block of the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would lead us from a world of <unk> bricks to each other to a world where it was all interactive.
Just like the concrete, the transistor allows you to create much larger circuits and more complex circuits at the same time.
But there's a difference -- the transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are quiet to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they put together through magnets.
So you can't put it very wrong.
<unk> have a colors.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange of the orange is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue one with a green and very quickly you can start making bigger circuits.
A blue one with a green one, produce light.
Can we put a button in the middle, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a light <unk>
And we had this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk> gestures that can be <unk>
To make it <unk> faster or more slow to just turn this button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to become <unk> ready to use.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We have given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light at night, or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without any expertise in electronics start to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, a few weeks ago, we took the <unk> of Rhode Island that you don't have any experience in engineering, just in wood and paper and said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a <unk> robot <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all of us.
So <unk> has open code.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world, is ours.
So let's go forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries today.
I work in the solar industry.
And my little company is looking for engaging with the environment focusing on in the <unk>
So distributed collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on the side of the side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, it was time for me.
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative ago to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that's supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> Peace <unk>
We have a few members every year, and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World -- we send it to the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk>
His task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
So meet <unk>
This is a wooden <unk>
So here it comes up as if I would find a quote, but what it really looks for is that someone gets to get it out of the snow because you know it's not very good by putting fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston had a team of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time we had a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else -- that the citizens <unk> with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you get it?
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, he put it <unk>
If you don't do, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a component playground.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications of the 21 year last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the Afghan government.
And it extends into a viral way.
A responsible system of <unk> <unk> when you see this application realized that he could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work on these days of tsunami, but people were stealing the batteries.
That's why he asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just launched it to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has been spread out of <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know a little bit of government technology, you'll know that this doesn't happen.
The software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that there was done by normal channels would have taken at least two and two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California that the moment has cost 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So a application that was program in a couple of days, and it spreads in a viral form of warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the best way to work, not as in private companies, as many people think it should be.
It's also not as a technological company, but rather as the own Internet.
I mean, without constraints, in a open way and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good at collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very big community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications, every day in their own communities.
They have not given the government.
Do you feel a great frustration to that, but you don't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that if we left the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that make us crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because you don't know.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to <unk> because things are changing.
Politics don't <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately <unk> from -- you remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to be able to <unk>
Well, after two years, I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of health care center and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark it in the U.S.
Scott <unk> This call.
He entered the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, and put it hard and see if you <unk>
And it worked. So by Scott.
But that's not the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a telephone center.
It has a <unk> and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
They didn't make that application.
It was the work of very clever people in the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened is this <unk> <unk> in my garbage cube I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
The dynamics of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I came up to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good evening <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physicist.
And it's also a great example of the income of government to the distributed civic collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition technology of platform.
I'm talking about a platform so that people will be <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected to the two people.
And it could be connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When a neighbor helps another, <unk> the communities.
If we call the <unk> of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the input of the other.
That our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen to a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will change our values and <unk> our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
Below is what we call <unk>
And we say that word <unk>
But it is that <unk> that holds us out of that that we funded as something that is operating on our against, that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the real government is happening.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk> them.
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed detailed report in response to the request of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's a serious activism in it.
And for those of us who have helped us with the government, it's time that we want to ask for our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they will have to face.
They really believe that we get to go to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on the name of <unk>
We can't do with the government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the government function so that it can expand to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that difficult to act -- just to articulate the systems in the right way.
The age of age of our members is 28 years old, so I, to <unk> I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up with the word and giving it almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face on who is going to go, everybody will talk about.
They can express their opinions at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem they don't really care about making your voices.
They're using your hands.
They bring the work to work to program applications that do better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a fire hydrant, pulling them up, dumping a trash cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have <unk> those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are as a digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not just consumers consumers and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we didn't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, we're going to be a crowd of voices, or we'll also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons.
I've spent the most part of my life in communities and places and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulation has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here is impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it makes sense and a force that wouldn't have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
Here we have seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have a special sense.
A doctor can do good, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of law, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional family house, dominated by a <unk> who was my grandmother.
It was hard to be strong, it was power.
It was the last word in the entire family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia on the <unk>
She was born about <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and I looked at him, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk> me.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> he came up to me and say, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he told him no, I was going back again and if he said yes, I was leaving it to peace.
I had this human quality that would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that he had 10 kids.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it was not easy to capture their time and his attention.
My cousins were running all over the place.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at it, and she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up and went through the room, and he took me out of my hand and said, "Come on <unk> we are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't get it. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I will never forget it.
Then he said, "I want to tell me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me is you always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
And then he said, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you're always going to do the right thing, even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I <unk>
Then he finally said, "I have the third thing that I want you to tell me is that I would never be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
I grew up in the field, in the South <unk> I have a older brother and a sister a year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and me and we went for the forest.
We just got the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> and you always do the same thing that we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I looked at it with strength and <unk> "Oh, it's not going to be thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I say it by the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that don't really make sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe being able to do.
I think my grandmother could naturally believed that all of his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of diseases of alcohol.
And these were the things that we had to, according to it, we had to <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there's 2.3 million.
In the United States, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, it's so much <unk> so much despair, by these facts.
One of each three black men between 18 and 30 years is in prison or a fluke.
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, Baltimore School, Washington Washington, 50 to 60 to 60 percent of all the young color of the color in jail, or in parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth is <unk>
And it seems to be very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not our problems of our own problem.
We're <unk>
It seems to me interesting.
We're looking at our work in our work some very curious developments in our work.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you love the rights for always if you have a criminal fight.
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of black male population has lost the right to vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years the level of loss of rights will be so high to the way it was before the law of the right to vote.
So we have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where I was worth 13 years to die in prison.
We have this country prison for kids, without chance of getting off.
Right now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They were helping people at death row
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense, they have been asked to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding if people deserve to die for crimes <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty death is defined by mistake.
Out of nine <unk> people have identified one that is innocent who is <unk> and released from death row of death.
One rate of mistake, <unk> an innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
And in aviation it would never be allowed to be able to be able to fly airplanes if every nine to <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
And it's interesting that in my class with students on history, I talk to you about slavery today.
I talk to you about terror, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and that went to the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a kind of defined <unk>
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried to be <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are people older than come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches talks, <unk> <unk> to people who stop saying that in our history we're dealing with terror, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> that grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was obviously in the segregation and decades of <unk> racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what we've historically done.
All of the time that's going to do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome our racial segregation without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death penalty conference.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know it's rather disturbing to listen to what you would expect.
<unk> We don't have death penalty in Germany.
<unk> we could never have it here."
The room stayed quietly and a lady said, "There's no way that with our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, <unk> and <unk> we could run the people."
Tell me about this.
How do we behave in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their <unk>
We could not find it.
That would be irrational.
And yet there is this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, the good things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But <unk> those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, you need to integrate those two things.
Today we talk about the need for more hope, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking about and talking about the poor, the ones that never come to TED.
And you think about them is, in a way, something that's within our self.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are, despite being so rational, so committed to the intellectual <unk>
With creativity. The development is coming from not just the brain ideas.
These things come from ideas -- also for the convictions of the heart.
So this connection to mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a willingness to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no <unk> <unk> with technology and design, that allows us to truly be human beings if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer from meeting <unk> <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> called me to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
You want to come up and <unk>
I said, "Yes, lady. I know <unk>
So she would say, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going to go and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. <unk> was headed to me and said, "Now, <unk> me to tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
So what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, no freedom for children.
We try to do something about death penalty disease.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech, and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that moment, Ms. <unk> <unk> he put my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that every one of us is higher at the worst we've ever <unk>
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't <unk> not that it's a <unk>
Even, if someone kills another, it's not a <unk>
So I think there is a basic dignity in people who must be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's it.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I believe that even though it's very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge ourselves by our technology, by our design, or by our intellectual capacity.
By the end of a society, the character of a society, not because of the way they treat rich, powerful and <unk> but by the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand really profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I get too much.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these kids who have been convicted of a lot of <unk>
I go to prison, and I see my customers of 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> so they were fed as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone in what isn't it?
The judge <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night she was very late -- I was up to <unk> for God, if the judge can become something that you don't do, because you have to have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> <unk> a little, black.
I started to work in the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my black client to be treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> executive from a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there have been <unk> behavior in the <unk> behavior and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical and a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> it would be a dream, or really <unk>
And for my horror, not only the <unk> I had sent it to the cut.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally I said, "Oh my God, I have to go to the court for this stupid case.
I got in the car, and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went into the court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
He finally came up with the car <unk> to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found a black man -- he was the <unk> of the court.
When I saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "This is you <unk> I said yes.
So I walked up and <unk>
And I was looking at the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That is deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When the judge came in.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> <unk> And we started <unk>
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was that I had written those <unk>
They got the policemen the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. They all cool because we were talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> <unk> I was going to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
And he would look through the window, and you could hear all that <unk>
And I kept walking over here, and for there.
Finally, this old black, <unk> face in the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> I showed you <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> on the old black man.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black stood up, I looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, "I've got this young kid to tell this young woman who keeps his view on the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds to justice.
That we can't truly be human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and by dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of the ones here who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, from this community, to help in your own way, to do something.
Something that isn't a check -- what can we do?
<unk> There are several close opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be an effort to <unk> the funds that are spent in policies of punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars worth of death, in the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases were not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes are not at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law, the security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, you have to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say is it?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in massive <unk> in this country is not because of crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war against drugs.
This is why this increasing increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to <unk> chain to steal a bicycle, by small crimes against property, rather than making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've got to be excited about this today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months. They could be in the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media media prefer negative news, because our minds pay attention to.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters more than survive, the first stop of all of this data is an excerpt from the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the danger.
<unk> and records all the information for something in the environment that could make us harm.
And so from a <unk> of stories, looking at the negative.
That old adage -- "If there are blood blood, it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe, in change, what really happens is we got <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress was done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the extinction species, the scarcity of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long run, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average life has been more than <unk> average per capita income has been <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced to 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, from the electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful little of the history of humanity.
And Charles <unk> that the world's literacy went from 25 to over 80 years in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we keep <unk> and higher expectations
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, toilets, <unk> television, mobile, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the past, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
And so much of this is the technology and <unk> its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we had in the information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and double the price of price at about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, how soft it is -- in good and bad time -- in war and peace, in recession in depression and <unk>
It is the result of fast computers used to build faster.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> in a law on the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually faster and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends in <unk> call existing computing and sensors and networks, 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet, biology -- fossil biology, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" from Watson, <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked in the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to human opponents <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
They have the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence on the cloud, available to all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year, we asked them to release a company, or a service or service, that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can actually impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> of the planet, is to create a life of the possible.
It's about taking this thing that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of <unk> from the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> to <unk> King <unk>
<unk> troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate the <unk> of aluminum.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth more than the gold and the <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington line to Washington is from aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the mass of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure <unk>
It's tied for oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came and made the aluminum thing as cheap that we use it as it was <unk>
And we had this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about need, it's <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents a hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's now talk about the water.
You remember when Carl Sagan wrote the spacecraft to report the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after the <unk> country.
<unk> a famous picture of how they <unk>
"A pale point.
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in a 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent ice, and we fought the water <unk> of the planet, but also here is a hope.
It's a technology that's available not in 10 to 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small hole.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any fresh source, saltwater, contaminated water -- a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke has just thought that I'm going to do a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes all right, and I have full confidence that I'm going to be, Coca-Cola will implement the world in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation by this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration of the mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that mighty warrior has better mobile communications.
And if you have a smart mobile phone, you have access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have ever existed.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid up tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video libraries of books and music, <unk> technology -- <unk> technology -- now <unk> and lose value value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get when it comes to health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called the X <unk> <unk> of 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we <unk> these technologies in a mobile device that you talk, and because they have <unk> they can be able to wash blood from the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle world in which there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there's <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that you won't call the health of the health and first of all, prevent the pandemic happening.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we're going to go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before you add to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you get? What would you <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health, thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy -- and because of using 3D impressions and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide 3,000 million more members of humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about a few voices ever before.
What if we give them to <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and you can act for the first time?
What about these 3,000 million?
And if they are contributions that we cannot <unk>
Something that I learned with the X Prize, is that small, guided teams of their passion with an objective of course, can do things -- things that were previously able to do great corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein.
The folds determine the structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this college professors, each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the recognition machinery of human patterns is better than proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the great challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are going to happen to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we need to do.
We have a couple of remarkable decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like this.
They actually look at fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is in the <unk> Red <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, the Galapagos.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures are still saying they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: the changes of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from some <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 feet -- the black <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had declined in half.
They went back to the five inches.
It takes a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
So nothing has changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of fishing fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the decade of 1970, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was imposing the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the Industrial
And this boat, pretty cool -- called <unk> 4.
I went out to fishing in it, and we ran in the south of the Southern China Sea and mostly in the Sea of <unk>
What we captured there was a <unk>
<unk> now I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny things about <unk> remains of coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary, because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start the commercial fishing.
The bottom line is going to be a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
Then they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collected every time they go to an area that they never have fish.
But there's no <unk>
We did the world, but we don't remember it.
<unk> the starting point at the next level, without remembering what was there.
If you look, this is something like this.
On the axis and we have things that we have <unk> biodiversity, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use images from the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and the extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the amount of changes.
And at the end of the end to keep a <unk> <unk>
And that, in large extent, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when illegal societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very prevalent before <unk> is a bit uncommon.
You don't lose animals.
You lose small animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a poor sea of big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time, there's a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they would expect the evidence.
So for example, the anecdote that some of them were <unk> like Captain such as a lot of fish in this area can't be used or usually not use the scientists of fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that can make a protected marine area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we actually <unk> the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has been run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine protected protected and can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do that because they don't have access, like the people in the Middle Midwest, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema can actually fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why <unk> <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that giving, is to <unk> <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today, we will see why the videos are making viral and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
They get over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a little percentage of the percentage of it gets viral -- gets lots of visits and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of <unk> and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views on the peak of the summer.
<unk> was not saying to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were a lot of videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> ran this story to the <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> are presented to us new and interesting things and <unk> them to a larger audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on a Friday.   Everybody wants to get the end of a week, the weekend.   <unk> Friday.
<unk> <unk> Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come from nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day this day in <unk>
Well, it took a <unk> and many blogs started to write about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science was one of the first people in making a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of <unk> will embrace a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this big internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this communal participation is our way of being part of the phenomenon or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an suspended animation with a <unk> music.
That's it. That's it.
This year was about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a three version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
Until the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats to see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old version of it.
And then it was <unk>
All of a sudden, came up a whole community of delegation that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all be <unk>
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or B, Black or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written to be written by this situation?
In a world that you go up two days of video in a minute, just that really unique and unexpected thing can be <unk> so these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy that <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't really bother too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by not circular by the <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep you fish properly by the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> got five million to see and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth all the new things that we do in creative form.
And all of this leads to a big <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend creative, creative communities, which are totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media -- which we all have access and is the audience that we all have access and the audience that defines the popularity thing.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They don't borrow permission to express your ideas.
We are now a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, and they are just the current media of today, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the only unit of oneness and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> in <unk> facing the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words for so long friends, I have now <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken through history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother was never allowed to forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat to the dawn <unk> it turned into the sea.
My mother, <unk> had only only 18 years when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been meant to a <unk> task for her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do this.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat went into the sea <unk> of ship <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the mess, rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a poison.
And if we were <unk> we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are of that boat, the constant pace of the motor, <unk> diving into each <unk> and the vast and empty horizon, <unk>
I don't remember the pirates that came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage to the men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to break for six hours.
But I can remember the lights in the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, he was too much to it; and the first apple I did, given by the men from the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, they were <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations to shape a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrant <unk>
Unlike the suburbs of the middle class -- the existence of the existence in <unk> there was no sense of right.
The smells of the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked on farms, then in a <unk> assembly line, working six days, double shift.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk> of the <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and they set an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, it wouldn't matter what it was supposed to be <unk> who was usually <unk> it was always <unk>
Two <unk> pairs for school, one to hide holes from the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back again.
At home, where?
Something in me was <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were talking about our day and we were hearing the motions of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares were able to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the mad and angry <unk> and <unk> kids caught between two worlds.
They were looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they were created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic Catholic student, <unk> with what it was <unk> from myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives -- tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them got help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of college, I was elected by the young woman of a year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to another, but the edges of the <unk>
As a <unk> resident <unk> was now to <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk to sites that I'd never heard of, and in houses whose existence would have ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for nearly 20 years old, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had the same age that she had when we got up to the ship.
Fear had never been a choice.
<unk> told me, "What don't you <unk>
So I talked about <unk> <unk> and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking, the more it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, a lot of them doing what they were doing, living on the border of as possible.
And although I finished my work, I realized I couldn't stay in a career for <unk>
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a unknown, a newly come new on the scene -- and not only it's fine, but it's something that is so grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps outside of my comfort zone to know that, yes, that the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that didn't have been <unk> they were <unk> <unk>
There was a energy there, a rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
They brought a little group of people for who the slogan cannot be <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year, we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant <unk> of soup that all <unk>
They go to good entry at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant, and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
And after one journey.
My hunches again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure.
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of her husband, he caused an <unk> to the <unk> and to take the cause of her and much more <unk> caused when I won.
It cannot be done it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the fourth of a hotel in <unk> when she died 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw him stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure we were still with it.
At night, a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is your hand and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life we have built us now -- we can see that the men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would have been very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might want that to know?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave in each <unk> the <unk> pace of the motor, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could take them and see them -- I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of course, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, in the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the old <unk> Indian <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and they would break the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when you <unk> the great prince warrior federal warrior -- he had <unk> he had <unk> he was getting a bow and a <unk> on the floor, her water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was going to tell me a lot.
Every time I felt a little bit more about <unk>
I was given to me this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
I thought technology had to allow the magic, not to kill her.
As a girl my grandfather gave me the <unk> <unk>
And this technology piece was for my <unk>
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of pirates and <unk> in my imagination.
And I had the feeling that the mobile clocks and the camera clocks and the cameras prevent it out.
We love our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came up with this technological world to see how to use magic, rather than killing her.
They were going to show books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad -- I saw a narrative device to the entire world of the entire world.
Can you know how to take the book.
Where are, where we are.
Put the text together with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what do we do with that?
I'm about to launch an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so --  -- he says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I became a character of the book.
In several moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- which comes to me.
My inner kid gets excited with all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that were <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar had always turned out to <unk>
So over here, we have to change the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually, they light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book, and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag up to this magical device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy I have always been maps but they've been static maps.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and guides you during the rest of the book.
In certain dots of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a child history <unk>
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And by talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems for the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not to be left to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can get our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that we have to go out there, take the camera or the iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason children don't do it.
So to restore this childhood ritual to go out and forth -- and in one chapter, I would get a photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of photos that then can put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child from India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Inside the aggregate variants between the magic and the Earth and technology is so many possibilities.
In the next book, we asked a interaction where you get out with the iPad and the video on and through an augmented reality, you see a group of cartoons that appear on the interior of the house.
And at a moment, the screen is full of leaves out there.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to be a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology come to one another.
It takes the energy of the sun.
We're getting close to our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that magic, joy and love love to sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of <unk> projects.
And I think, really, that the most important thing is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk> <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or maybe not all of all, but most of the projects of <unk> are fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> and <unk>
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I was going to get my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor doctor has access to him as well. And so he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time when you need insurance assistance or some urgency of that style, but I saw it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you get to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today, I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week we are available to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And the people who are monitoring their homes, take their blood pressure, provide their doctor and share with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, come back and recover control of their own <unk> but it can also help us care of health care because of the challenges that we face, like the firing rate of attention and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with a video of you.
All of us have the controls of navigation in the <unk>
Maybe even we have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where ATM machines are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one <unk>
No one knew where to get <unk> saves life right now.
What we did was <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public, you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, when it's open, because it is open, since it is that sometimes open up in <unk> <unk> and other are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality, to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone else <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next weeks to use your cellphone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I want to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to save them at the global level.
We are <unk> to all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that we will help us find, work and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
And I also want companies to invite companies around the world that could help us find these <unk>
They could be a message services or people from <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that is shown in their place.
Please hang on this and not only better health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, it's photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in photography woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed up with my previous drawing -- but it was a little bit different because when we use the camera the process was in the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera -- the process ends up when you press the <unk>
For me photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
I thought anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by press the <unk>
<unk> like this: construction in a very <unk> road.
But it has a twist on it.
And despite that, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful things at the time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say, "Oh, I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can say, but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way like photography.
So I think you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what's the trick that makes it look real?
Is it the details or the <unk>
Do you remember light?
What does it create <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is your perspective.
But at the end it's about our way to interpret the world, and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but of what we think it's realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality that we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if it was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's get into the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process when we combine the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look realistic -- I think they're those ones that don't even understand the things that are around us in our everyday life.
But when we combine the photographs very important -- because otherwise something is going to look wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that are going to continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures are <unk> they must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken at the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to do impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect direction.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
Could you think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
In the staff, I think it's easier to create a place that we find out because you don't need to get the ideas that are in the head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter, I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a stone stone well.
And yes, I even made the house of the top of the island of the island for more <unk>
So to make a realistic result of it, I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then we have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and at the time very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing one slide about technology, very boring.
Please be able to <unk>
It's a diagram anyone who took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> microprocessors versus the power of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, as many other that we tend to see, is a kind of straight line on a logarithmic scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here's a strange thing.
And that's what I'm just going to talk about.
Please light out the lights.
They get more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do we make technology <unk> <unk>
The answer is that if you draw the drawing on a regular curve in which, say, these are the years or a few hours, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to make -- the diagram would see something ludicrous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it's a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transport technology will be as quickly as the <unk> tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There's no <unk> in the history of technological development -- that every few years, orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- looking at these curves -- we see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
It was one of two things.
Or it will be a typical curve. I know like this until something entirely different, or maybe I'm going to do something like this.
That's all it can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is, what is that new way to adopt the world?
Why is the world <unk>
The transition is very, very <unk> if we are engaged in it.
I remember, the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
So a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different that we extrapolate are doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of the time I would like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back a few and a half billion years when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with many chemicals that are going around it.
If you look at the way those chemicals <unk> we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is that, at that time, there were about oil <unk> with all kinds of chemicals in its inside.
Some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate from the outside and so that drops grew up grew up grew up grew up in the outside and so on.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell shapes -- those oil <unk>
But those drops were not alive, in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> <unk> a chemical distribution of chemicals that are <unk>
So every single droplet was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow <unk> being better at the time of carrying chemical chemicals grew more chemicals and <unk> more.
Most of the time, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, chemistry -- very simple, but things become interesting <unk> when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe from the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this Darwinian evolution -- a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that this system of writing seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living person is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> now can we write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white powder that I try to hide to the airport people from the airport.
But <unk> took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to the 22 times.
So if someone wants to be 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it in a virus, and it would have spread through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step of DNA.
This made these cells are happy to be another billion years.
But then there was another big step in which things got very different -- and that was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information into a cell community.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, it evolved resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to form communities that, in a way, they were together in that and set up a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community <unk> more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities were very excited that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe from the community board into a string of DNA.
The next stage is interesting to life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is not serves without the heart, or of the muscles, or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels that cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
They started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't make information in community.
They are neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that these mobile communities are <unk>
In fact, they started <unk> within the community as the structures that are responsible for us to understand and transfer the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the evolutionary period of time.
So one organism could, for example, learning not to eat some fruit because she knew bad and got sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that they had built these information processing structures that evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit <unk>
So the fact that the nervous system built those structures of information that accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now be confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is the human language.
So if we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea in the head.
I'm sitting here now emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in your heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated -- we convert it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing abstractions.
We now went through periods of periods of <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods -- presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape video tape -- the <unk> and so on.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program, in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you took a billion years each.
The next few days, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The following, language and so on, took less than a million years.
And following, as the electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we observe in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent technologies.
But now design objects that would be impossible for me to do it in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor on that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine that does something that you could not possibly did, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these random instructions at random to run all of those programs, and take those who are more excited about what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are closer to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, was able to find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that were better at <unk>
You get those and <unk> to the rest.
And now I think that the best <unk>
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to the <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who are <unk> <unk> and that the children will <unk> the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of computer programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's build it again.
There were some mutations -- some mutations ...
And it tries to bring it back and <unk> with another generation.
Well, each generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that are absolutely perfect numbers.
In fact, they are much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell how they work.
I've tried to test them to see how they work.
They're dark programs, strangers.
But do you get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives depend on doing this.
I was once on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce a lot more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there are.
It goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing is getting faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at an analog moment of the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what it is.
But now comes lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I get <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give me some of my false <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and using them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called the average <unk>
And we're talking about 300 than a <unk> who was <unk>
That means the <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the game without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to throw it to the first base -- it doesn't get time to the time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone who has 10 <unk> <unk> four.
<unk> as legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the League of <unk> <unk> in a regular season in a regular season in a regular season in a regular season in a regular season in a regular season.
Now I'm going to take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more <unk> or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're a surgeon who has a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place remote and a dear person has two clogged arteries and your family doctor is derived to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting better at this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask:
What do you think must be the average of hits of a heart surgeon or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
<unk> very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in medicine knows the hits.
What we do, however, is <unk> the world, and I joined myself with <unk> of being perfect.
I would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I thought about when I was in medical school.
I was a ethnic student, <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studied to a blood <unk>
Such which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the head of <unk> in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned from all memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnostic diagnosis -- frequent <unk> and the <unk>
And even known the diagnostic diagnosis of how they classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was going very well; I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if you were born, everything, then you would know everything, or as possible, close to all, because so I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady <unk> to the emergency room where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I was able to go back to a cardiologist I was going to go to that patient <unk>
And I will report to the chief chief <unk>
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which was <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and, instead of <unk> the blood forward, blood goes to our lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I read it.
He gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
I gave him a little bit of water pills so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more errors.
He sent her home to her house without talking to the chief of vote.
I didn't get up the phone, and I did what I should have done, which I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, would have been able to make information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that makes constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take advantage of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send it to your house, I didn't recognize a voice in my inside that would say, <unk> it's not a good idea. Don't do it.
In fact, I was so insecure that I was able to ask the nurse that I was taking care of the <unk> <unk> who is okay if it goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said with total <unk> "Yes, I think it's okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
And so he signed the high school, and the ambulance next to the ambulance was taken to her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I went off to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that point I did something that I don't do normally, I don't do.
It went through the emergency room at home.
And there is another nurse, not that I was having a <unk> lady before, but another one told me three words -- those three words that most emergency doctors <unk>
Other specialists fear them, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are, remember you?
"It remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I came back and on the verge of death.
After an hour of having come to her home, after I was giving her high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> had brought it to emergency room with a blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock shock of <unk>
I was just breathing and it was blue.
The emergency personnel <unk> all their resources.
They gave medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
I had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> he was in intensive therapy and hoped against all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was obvious that he never will.
He had a brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was going to be amazed at what was happening.
And the ninth day, he left her to go. The lady <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks, I was blown away by this and first of the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat down by himself, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't <unk> with your colleagues.
You make peace and it never makes that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is what makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I spoke to the family, and I'm sure I would take things and make sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day, <unk> opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I was going to get the efforts to be perfect for not to make any more errors, I would try to cease to get out of those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, he was an emergency department in the emergency department in the northern hospital in Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years old with pain in the throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her throat, I was a little <unk>
He sent him penicillin penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran to the door still pointing up his throat.
Two days later, when I came to make my guard change, my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I gave the three words: remembers you?
Remember the patient in the <unk>
He came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially mortal condition called <unk>
You can put it on Google. It's an infection, not because of the throat, but it can cause the close of those tracks.
He said, fortunately, not <unk>
You get antibiotics for antibiotics and they recovered at a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened again and again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the E.R. not <unk> <unk>
And this is a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because you were getting 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
And we had an X-ray X-ray but it turned out, a colleague of colleague that I was checking the patient in the bottom right-hand corner and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
He ordered her liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it through and see some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner called the surgeon.
They both were operated and they recovered well recovered too.
But every case I was struck by me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most significant ones have been over the last five years.
They become embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: If I can't get to me and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I teach this to not make the same <unk>
If I could go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- I think I'd have a hard time to look at it to look at it.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of the mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and those who don't sleep that they can't sleep and the ones that I know -- who have a lot of great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, as the antibodies start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you stop medicine to people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and journalism, I've done a personal personal study of bad medical <unk> and mistakes to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Toronto <unk> to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that the mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where the mistakes happen every day, where one of 10 drugs are going to be in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right. In a system where <unk> infections are increasingly and more <unk> by chaos and death.
In this country, they die 24,000 Canadian to mistakes medical mistakes.
The U.S. Institute of Medicine set up 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is speeding up every two or three years, and we don't care about it.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect record.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest chest chest <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to alcohol and all of a sudden my story is <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
For all this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> us, and we remove all the professional professionals -- well, you won't get anybody.
And with it that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art -- it's already a habit saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everyone, from the <unk> to the chief of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the microphone to them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> down the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They were able to say, "Look, they don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical doctor is human, and it's human, and they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to be able to learn from what happened to teach others.
They were looking at their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They give the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but a loving way and support for everyone to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a doctor <unk>
I'm a human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel so much but effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we took one day.
You know how much we choose a week?
And I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick up an average American -- it's about 70 to a day.
Not a lot of ago in a research followed by a week to a group of companies.
Researchers at the different tasks are driven by these executives and the time that we <unk> to make decisions with those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> a week.
Naturally, every work included many, many <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many people belong to nine minutes, and how many of a <unk>
How is the way the way that deals with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems today to choose to the <unk> of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm a blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
In another way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive, please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, you're ready to hear about the problem of the overload of <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, I had this very, very <unk> supermarket at least at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> more than 500 different types of fruit and vegetables and about 25 of water -- and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was like, why I never buy nothing?
This is a shelf of the oil <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> box that came from trees <unk>
I once decided to visit the manager and I said, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of a tourist coming out of every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>

They had a different classes.
<unk> a <unk> at the entrance to the store.
We put it out there <unk> of six <unk> or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what if people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped at the time there was a <unk> that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
What was stopped when there were only three percent of us to buy <unk>
When there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably are likely to make sure -- less good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of <unk> options affects us to make us good <unk>
We decided to decide, even to decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the issue of a day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the decisions about savings for a million Americans, from about a million plans of this country.
We were interested in to see if the number of <unk> available plans for retirement, the <unk> program will help people save for the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans from two, to 59 different options.
What we found was that the majority of the funding fund was less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was from 70 or more, not as high as he wanted to.
And in the plans that offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation went into the '60s.
It turns out even if you decide to participate when there are more options, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for the ones that decided to participate, the more the number of choice, more people will be able to avoid actions or investment funds.
As soon as there were more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial bank financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are striving to optimize our future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences to the most and more possibilities.
And the most likely thing is that we will make the decision, even when this is against the self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to choose things less than <unk> although objectively you get better.
The main reason is to be able to look at that wide variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, contrast and choose from that amazing <unk>
Today I want to introduce you to four simple techniques that we have, in one way or another, in different research, so they can test in their business.
The first one is <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, than this is less than today.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually, what we're looking at is that if you decide to cut, get rid of odd options -- there will be a <unk> increase in the sales, and there will be a better experience in the election.
When <unk> & <unk> was 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation <unk> <unk> all of the products for <unk> of cats who were less <unk> were increased by <unk> by two major sales and low <unk>
You know that the supermarkets in the average offer 45,000 products.
In a grocery store, they offer about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato
In the world of the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle better choices is the <unk> of David <unk> the Harvard program.
All of the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a fund of life.
The people who are really willing to do is give you 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these are <unk> options.
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience a vacation for all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want the <unk>
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give a hand if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first <unk> than in the second -- but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to drive the problem of the <unk> which is <unk>
So people understand the differences between the differences between any choice, they have to understand the consequences of every choice, and that the consequences must be very <unk> very concrete ways.
Why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit cards than when they use it yet.
Because it doesn't seem to be real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk> who were working in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting -- which is exactly like <unk> we had a little <unk>
So what we added was that he gave the personal staff to think about the positive things that are going on in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent and an increase in the number they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a aisle of magazines.
We saw that in the supermarkets of the <unk> the exhibition of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the classification tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know what?
This is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something to <unk> not that the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge <unk>
Are I supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think about if we just get it a little bit.
We have to increase complex complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good job of a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 decisions, to build your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
<unk> color in the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order that makes the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, to a few <unk> boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few options, four boxes, to 56 colors, so many options.
And what will I <unk>
What about you are.
If you <unk> always the default button in each decision, this tells you that they're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that those who are going to have a lot of options at a few times, <unk> button over and again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, many continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order of information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
But if you choose the box of changes doesn't say anything about the preferences of <unk> interior, in all ways you make us a choice.
We are excited about a product we're building that now has more engaged in the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- we can manage more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented to them were designed to help us manage the <unk> or better, for you to use them in their own business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to the best of one choice is to be careful about <unk>
And the more we be able to be in our choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter it had to go to the government.
You had to register a sheet of text written with the machine.
And so the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written with the wrong message, they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't conceive of that someone could do this, how much it would make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color of any big manufacturer and print one page, that page will end up having some little yellow yellow dots on every page that you follow a pattern that makes them own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be <unk> a lot of this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use the technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world, we can bring up the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
No like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
It's very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the <unk> to win a lot of money, a huge amount of numbers.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that we would take money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their fortunes go online, but they do it by illegal media through banking <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The U.S. secret service, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most <unk> crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we observe today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves around, they motivate them to motivate them to motivate them to motivate them to motivate them.
Groups have <unk> in the last 12 months in the last 12 months in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do to protest and the last group are the national United States governments to <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government beating against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of <unk> authority or, actually, it was.
<unk> the world's last fall because of a <unk>
You know, the safety of the site and it took a <unk>
Last week, I said, in a meeting with representatives of the Dutch government asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> the death of people who have a result of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how does people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do you do <unk>
Well, you need to have a website with <unk> services, <unk> <unk> services like <unk>
Except for a foreign authority authority.
And they were emitting <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters -- the headquarters of the secret secret <unk> artist in April 2011, and during <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government and the tools to intercept the large scale of the citizens of the country.
They sold this tool for 280 euros to the Afghan government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to governments to do that to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this on themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to research their own citizens.
If you're suspicious of a criminal case -- well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's going further.
You get the connection to the Internet.
They have even tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the argument online, to get our data.
When we think closely about things like these obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument makes no sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we spend today, will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future government, in a management that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to be worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows of my dad at the background, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences in the most part of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value it.
So I grew up with a lot of lions.
They were dying are victims that protect our community and cattle, and they are also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, of six to nine years is responsible for his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were afraid.
But I realized that actually not <unk> because it even helped lions to see the pen <unk>
I didn't get <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
It was trying to trick lions to believe that he was close to the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came up the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So I jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come out.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that is moving.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that will turn on and off the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a broken tail.
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel burden the battery load the battery and the battery opens the electricity to the little box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> you get outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how you see the lions when they come at night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> to lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never got a problem with lions.
And the houses of the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see in the background, these are the lights to lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot of it.
And my idea is also used for all Kenya, to scare other predators as <unk> <unk> and it's also used to kill elephants from those farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship in one of the best schools of Kenya, International International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise fund and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses that don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a little boy in the lawns of the savanna <unk> cow cows -- and he used to watch airplanes fly and said that someday would be inside of you.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in the plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer from aviation and pilot when you <unk>
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like you.
So you get a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electric inventions at all.
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close power. CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that we have been invented by fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: So I heard it once, right now, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but two because I got a <unk>  CA: So the foot of the cannon. Richard <unk> are a big thing.
We're going to be <unk> in every single step that you have a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all of the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
But sometimes I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed a sudden changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public meetings.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When we <unk> this -- the five members of the family will be left in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks of past weeks.
We're <unk> together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak, that we're ready to die."
I was very done.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At a while, when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child in his arms looking at the face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine will come to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, more than one million North Koreans died for famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and temporal cortex.
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all around me was completely on dark at night except by the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> at certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river, sometimes.
I can't tell the details of how I left out of North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of famine I was sent to China to live with <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life is going to be like refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just hard, but also dangerous, because the North refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was done, when I was arrested by Chinese police and <unk> at the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then I would have my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and ask the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer told another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum <unk>
But many of them can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although there were <unk> they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Although I was fortunate to get away many other North Koreans have not had so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to put in the South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, and I had to start learning my third language.
I also understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We are all <unk> but inside, we have come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
They even went through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call with a pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, and I started to study for the exam exam to college.
Just as I was starting to get to my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities -- some money I sent to my family, and as though my family was going to be shifted to the force at a remote location in the <unk>
They had to run away.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and <unk> to the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to take it in a way, for over three miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and addressed by a police officer.
He asked them all and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer approached my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> who was <unk>
And I looked at me <unk> but fortunately he believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the poorest dots in my life.
I did all for free to my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at the short distance of South Korea.
I was going to go between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or a voice of a man ask me, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind asking.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and to get them out of prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I said, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The unknown unknown is a new hope for me and for the village to be able to get the <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are actually the rays of the hope that the people would be needed.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea, and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community education, language practices -- and more.
We can also act like the bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with relatives still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help us giving North <unk> an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans <unk> around the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in <unk>
This is Center for <unk> stores of <unk> food, fast terrain.
So the planners of the city came together and thought, we're going to change the name of South Center to represent something else, so they changed the South Los Angeles -- as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> of <unk> food -- fast terrain.
Just like <unk> million other Americans, I live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center, home to the home of the food in order to take and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that the food places to carry killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles, <unk>
For example, obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times that, say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 kilometers away.
I emphasize that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel like if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of home, you see the effects of current food that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see <unk> <unk> and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers.
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
<unk> is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have <unk>
What I did, it was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In one of the land we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters x three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to run it.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided it worked.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we got together, and we started planting our forest of food, trees -- you know, the nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of <unk> <unk> composed of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, I was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city got me on top and in short, they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to take my own garden, the <unk> was made order.
And I said, "Come on.
A failed order for planting food in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  And so he was like, "Well, let's get it."
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> and we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
The L.A. is the U.S. <unk>
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 <unk>
That's enough space for planting <unk> million <unk>
Why on earth does it not seem well like this?
<unk> a plant will give a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars to result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, <unk> your own food.
<unk> your own food is like <unk> your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up with my children there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
As an artist <unk> <unk> walls, <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
They will be able to see what the earth can do, if you leave their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a education tool, in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They will be able to see how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one time, who came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my garden, and they looked very <unk>
And I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I was so close to me with hungry, and this just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes people are going to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh my God, I'm not afraid of going to <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to <unk> but at the same time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another time that I put a garden in a shelter to <unk> in downtown Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this had affected and how they used to plant with their mom and his grandmother, and it was a fabulous to see how this changed so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 garden.
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all of them in a voluntary plan.
If kids grow <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> they will eat <unk>  But if none of this will be told, if you are not taught how food is going to affect your mind and the body, eat blind and blind what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where they're caught. I see color guys who are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them anywhere.
And with the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids that get rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when do we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into healthy <unk>
I don't care about it.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try to work to people, get the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor to grow their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you take your <unk> take your <unk>
That is her weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I'm not calling me if you want to sit into comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Buy Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> --  <unk> from the <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very <unk>
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that you can <unk>
And especially if you go into your bike, and these cars go by, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a road <unk>
The solution to that is to do the roads of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, it has pores and water can go through it, so all the water water will flow into the sides and you will have a road that is easy to drive, and you don't get the water out of it.
The noise will disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise disappear, so it's a very silent road <unk>
It also has a <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that on this road the stones were out of the surface off.
They first went on a stone, then several more and more, and so on, and then -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But it can hurt your <unk> and you're not going to be happy with that.
And finally, this can also bring more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
Oh. It's ready.
<unk> of course, can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see how the damage comes up in this material.
It's a asphalt as I said, so it's only a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> <unk> and if you were <unk> they will be able to <unk> and split up from the <unk>
So if you're driving around the road, you will get the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> <unk> of that to clean <unk> and we can cut out the steel <unk> in very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with small pieces of steel <unk>
Then you need a machine, like the one that you see here, you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, is very good at it.
So what you have to do is heat up the steel -- melt the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones were <unk> back to the surface.
Today I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the great machine on the stage here.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tested many samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We need to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 feet of the highway highway in which we had to do a lane for testing this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road is going to have no harm. That's what we know of practice.
We took many samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> then with our machine <unk> and the <unk> and we came back to prove it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using fiber <unk> bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, and they can even double the surface of the surface of the road, they can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they're curious about whether this also worked.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
You actually have to cool first before I can show you how the repair works.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having aroused a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to the BBC of his little gray.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban would be <unk> yelled at my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban stood in Afghanistan and they made it illegal to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to get to my older sister who no longer could be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we were able to do it.
Every day, we would take a different route so that no one could be suspicious of where they are.
We had to hide the books in the market market so that we were flying shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but it's extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we <unk> our <unk> the teacher, our students and our parents.
And once in a week, the school suddenly got suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very fortunate to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> that his daughter, my mother, outside of school, and that's why her father would <unk>
But my mother educated became a teacher.
This is it.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of her family to receive education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even though they were <unk> despite the <unk>
For him, there was a higher risk for him, not to educate their children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember, there were moments I was very frustrated with our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter, you can lose everything you have in life.
They can steal your money. You can tell you to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So you still want to do it.
Today I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than high school, and if my family hadn't been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate myself in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from her home to educate her daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my college degree, but I also was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who led it to the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of what <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like my mine, <unk> for them, despite the fact that even though they had a opposition opposition.
As a <unk> It's not its true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and they literally escaped to be killed by a pump on the way, for minutes.
When you get to home, you're the phone, a voice told him that if he kept sending her daughter to school, they would go back to it.
<unk> now, if you <unk> he said, "but it won't harm the future of my daughter and <unk> <unk>
What I've realized, and it's something that is often often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who are <unk> there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they often are the early <unk> of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school count in <unk> remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls are going to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
And so I think these changes didn't last a lot, after the U.S. U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were doing for them, that the <unk> I see a future <unk> and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of <unk> I would get it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk> <unk>
It's almost two years since the broke revolution was inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> within and outside of the country to call a day of rage and initiate a revolution against <unk> regime.
And it was <unk> it was a great revolution.
Women and young men were in the <unk> <unk> the each of the regime, they are carrying for freedom, dignity and social justice.
You have shown a courage to face the brutal dictatorship dictatorship
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and a loss of about 50,000 dead, they were able to release our country and escape the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the moral structure of society <unk>
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've been dear to a lot of other women, to rebuild civil society -- <unk> an inclusive transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> almost 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of <unk> I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about development development and skills of leadership.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by the Peace -- a movement of women, leaders, of <unk> orientation to advocate for the women's autonomy of women and our right of our right participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is <unk> from the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was <unk>
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the early elections in 52 years.
However, little to little, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day I would have the news of the murder of the American Ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of police officers in the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> the human rights of human rights and their lack of respect of the law.
Our society, made by a <unk> mindset -- and it's been away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all for <unk> with our success of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm now here today to confess that we, as a nation, we get wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the choices didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination, and <unk> both by men like women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating consensus more than the election, that only <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the female representation of women's most likely to need the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as an outrage and call days of anger.
We need to begin to act as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, that not only <unk> but also put the <unk> rather than <unk> collaboration in the place of competition, we're doing it rather than <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by war, desperately desperately needs to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about <unk> and <unk> between female <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to set out that in an existential way to make it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the <unk> traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> which spans the entire humanity of men and women, that all the tribes and all the people have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus completely covers the <unk> that grows in, the divine array of compassion is <unk> all the existence.
This is how you say, "My <unk> covers all the things."
So you say, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
They were all given to you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a <unk> question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is that they all make the usual <unk> Why is it left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, or an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my soul <unk> <unk> me to the head with a <unk> <unk> <unk> bullets from <unk>
The man, when I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap in love, where each year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies from the list -- <unk> between them -- Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington D.C.
I'm about 20 years old, I was married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all of the race, all the religions, all of the income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> or, <unk> or said in a way, in the families, the last place where we would want or expect to find <unk> which is why, domestic abuse turns out.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would take with a man who hits you, and I actually was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women in the ages of 16 and 24 years of age have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than all of 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, its warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold, <unk> night.
I was sitting next to my side on the subway in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and who worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But the thing that struck me in that first meeting was that it was ready and funny, and that it seemed a guy in the field.
I had a few big <unk> and <unk> and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it all over the beginning of the <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved everything in me: which was ready that I had gone to Harvard, who would be passionate about helping teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like nobody had ever done before.
And it was why the arts <unk> and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence relationship is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York to leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so <unk> I left my job and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling in a <unk> <unk> that was coming out of head in a physical level, financial and a psychological psychological trap.
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As long as we moved to New England you know, that place where you are supposed to be so safe -- it had to be so safe to buy three <unk>
One had on the <unk> of the car.
Another thing kept it underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in their pocket.
And he said he needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived small.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me and, although I had never been lifted up my hand, my life was really serious about danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were the seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had <unk> I put the girlfriend of my mother and married me with him.
Despite what had occurred, I was confident that we were living happily forever, because I loved her and he also wanted a lot of it.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> for the wedding and by the fact of being a family with me.
It had been a <unk> accident, and I was never getting any harm.
I spent two times more on our moon.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> me, and he gave me so strong in the head that we were <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey was <unk> by traffic and threw me a Big Mac Mac to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or harassment at some point of life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk>
So I actually had a good company.
Going back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help us to face their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why is it just not <unk>
Why did I not bother me, I could have gone at any time.
To me this is the saddest and painful question that makes people, because we victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the domestic violence pattern is to kill her.
More than 70 percent of the killings in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has put the victim to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has become married, for financial resources, and manipulation of the family family system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend time with the man who <unk> his mother.
And yet we keep asking why it is simply not going?
I was able to <unk> because of one last <unk> beat up my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, I would have killed me if you've allowed.
So I broke the silence.
He told everybody -- to the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family family, and I am here today because all of you are going to be <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like <unk> <unk> women <unk> <unk>
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people this is a way to say, <unk> is <unk> by <unk> as if the victims of <unk> intentionally <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them and who are saving their lives joyful lives and happy lives like <unk> wives and <unk> lives out of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I actually am a victim and a survivor.
I went married with a cute man and kind of kind and got those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm going to do is not ever have any more, possibly a <unk> <unk> pointing to my head in someone who says it wants.
At this moment, they are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that are being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they're <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting your daughter, his sister, to your best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy love <unk> breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
They abuse only in silence.
They have the power of ending domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the <unk> to the light talking about it with their children, their friends and family.
They have their vision of survivors as people who are fantastic and <unk> who have a future <unk>
They were able to make the mathematical signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
Together, we can convert our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call this Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm model.
To be precise, for a 10 years.
And I feel that at this point there is a awkward tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed up like this.  Luckily, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first change on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when you die, they don't have to stand now, but I'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everyone has that opportunity.
And these magicians are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to go through this sweater for your head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as the head of my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've totally changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I was going to get the back and <unk> the hair of the guy.
Of course, except for surgery or an artificial <unk> like that I did two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, although shallow and <unk> has a big impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage, because I'm a model, I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman and in my workforce, and that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> I was discovered, but it doesn't mean nothing.
The real reason I became a model is because I won the genetic lottery and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk>
Well, over the last centuries we have not only defined the beauty as our health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape, <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I've known to harness to make money.
And I know there are people in the public that now show <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> <unk> <unk> That's <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, they would be able to find them out so much of models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York and he told all of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- <unk> models -- that was not white.
The next question that people always ask me is, could it be model when you were <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then what I would actually tell you to each of these girls is, why? Can you be what you want.
It can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon who was <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this spectacular list, I'm still <unk> No, no, <unk> I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of American American magazine or the CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that the bigger you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
Is it out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you get out of your studies, and you have a copy and some jobs on your back, no matter what it is, if you will, that you want to be president of the United States, but you hear your <unk> Model for 10 years, people look weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yeah, pretty much got all the pictures, but that's just a little part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So I was looking at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I'm at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those pictures.
They are creations of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, <unk> things for free?
I have too many six inches and I never use, except the couple of <unk> but the privilege I get is that I get them in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to carry money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to keep <unk>
So let's get rid of these privilege for my looks, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their <unk> no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and the past year, of the teenagers who were couple and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black men in New York City, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times do I <unk> <unk>
When I research this talk, I found out that when 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is, how is the life of an model?
And I think the answer that you hope is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the most bright hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also amazing to be able to work with creative people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my life every day.
And if you ever ask you to be a little bit more thin legs and the brightest hair will be happier.
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs -- the brightest hair and the most <unk> women in the planet.
But mostly it was hard to look at a situation of gender oppression and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something that will retain this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when we recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was the biggest enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you with my 15 little <unk> photos and I didn't have the <unk>
There were no <unk> no <unk> no chance to repeat photos, not even a little bit of careful in lighting.
In fact, most of them took a random tourists in fact.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and five.
He gave us the chance we came back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I approached the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists that they were going to give us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has ever been denied and fortunately, no one has been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five-year-old could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
It's also a way of stopping time in a week of October and to think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always took the same picture, our daughter changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how it perceives and interacts with everything.
That particular time that we spent together is something that we hope with illusion all the year.
So recently, in one of travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden he stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the baby <unk> <unk>
And I described to me what felt like the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who remembered your heart <unk> with strength when I saw that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that takes the picture.
So today I want to encourage everyone to come up in the picture, and you didn't get to come up with someone and asked, "Do you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> birds.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughs as <unk> <unk> <unk> stupid <unk>
More recently, if you've been following the <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't hold the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
They hardly are <unk>   Are you far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have more presence.  There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> in the New World who are mostly found in <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World <unk> where we have 16 species. From these 16, 11 people face a high risk of extinction.
So why are <unk> important -- first of all, they provide domestic ecological services <unk>
They are our natural garbage <unk>
You get the cadavers to the bone.
They help killing all the bacteria. They help to absorb the anthrax that they were not going to be due to them and causing great losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of disease <unk>
<unk> also have huge important importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of lip and <unk> and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the <unk> and below Egypt.
In the <unk> Hindu god was the god <unk> and <unk> his life to save the <unk> goddess of 10 heads <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are very important <unk> in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What is the problem with the <unk>
We have eight <unk> species in Kenya, which six are at the extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In the south of Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the endangered list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock of livestock that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned to use veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs in the number of dogs on <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge time bomb, and the number of time of anger has increased greatly in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to the birds.
They are <unk> birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the market of <unk>
So what are you doing? Well, we're investigating these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so you focus on a sustainable problem is not going to be at all.
We have to work with governments at the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can they help? It can become active -- make noise.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but they talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed opinion because he saw it <unk> without the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do, my life has been <unk> for seven years of work in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I'm not.   I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the <unk> that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
And instead of that, all we played the <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people of Zambia to grow food.
So we got the <unk> <unk> to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that goes down to the river <unk> and we teach the local tomatoes to grow Italians and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, because they were going to tell them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't have any <unk>  We were in fact that the local, in such fertile valley, were not had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we were not <unk> anything, we simply said, "Thank God that we're here."  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> In Italy, a <unk> tomato <unk> in Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> came up from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "My God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here,  "Why don't you do it? "You're never <unk>
I thought only of us was a lot of Italians in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, was doing what the Americans, they were doing the <unk> what the French did, and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk>  <unk> looking at the waste that would give you the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, donor countries, we've delivered to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about harm than that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from a African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if they were my kids, "I want a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face. Little is <unk> written by <unk> who said for the whole economic development -- if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor, and he said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided by the 27 years only to respond to people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start with anything, you never really engage somebody, but it becomes a <unk> of local <unk> the <unk> of the people who have a dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
It will never come into a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We met in a coffee. We came up with a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for her own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help us find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once you get to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for once, they were <unk> but not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings there.
<unk> would never be <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance they have <unk>
So, planning has this blind person.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't take their public meetings.
What do we do? We worked one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure -- which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business, who stands with you in their house, at the table of their kitchen, in the coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a form of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> town.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this <unk> crap where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to ask the question, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And so the government says, <unk> <unk>  So the government says, <unk> again.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> of history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy professor before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company of company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business <unk>
So now <unk> reconstructing the <unk> reconstructing what people most <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn to get these people to talk to you.
You have to offer <unk> privacy, it has to be great when you help and then are going to come up in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you show you more of this is tomorrow?
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So, what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution <unk> fossils are not renewable <unk> and at one point, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
government?
Will the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a fantastic story that I read in a communist magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> met this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would be no within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> they were tested --  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that we would have in New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States -- <unk> companies <unk> <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give you <unk>
Otherwise they will not come to talk with you.
Then you have to give you a absolute dedicated service.
And then you later have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The youngest company, the largest company has to be able to do three different things, the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic marketing and you have to count with a fantastic financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be able to sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This still wasn't born.
We've looked at it and looked at the 100 known companies of the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford -- all the new companies, <unk> <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common -- only one: None of it was started by one person.
I would never have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one begins a company alone.
So, we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in coffee <unk> along with their dedicated comrades who are going to do for you, what someone did for this <unk> someone who speaks about this <unk> -- someone who talks about this <unk> what to do?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> you can look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> I want you <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us from around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't get a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects arose from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door for a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes at the cows at cows so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> which give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
That always pushes the music.  There's a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture of the world, but also one with the most abandoned <unk>
I live close to this house and thought about how I could turn it into a more pleasant space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was suddenly sudden and <unk>
I thought a lot about death and I thought a lot.
And this made me very deep gratitude for the time of life.
It gave it clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But I was trying to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends turned the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and painted on her sentences to say, "Before he died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> to reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what waiting for this experiment, but the next wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die I want to be <unk> <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before I die I want to die for millions of people."
Before I die. I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live out of the <unk>
Before I die I want to die once again.
Before I die I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving the reflection of the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important to us as we grow and change ourselves.
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in civic center, we did a kit, and now there are walls in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, and beyond.
Together, we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions instead, it's more important than ever, to find the ways to keep the perspective and remember that life is very very quickly.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that it would prepare for death is one of those things that would become more power.
It's going to think about the death of our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us can't only help us improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single petition.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
He doesn't speak, but it transmits joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love is.
It's shared. <unk> happen to happen what's going on.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
You don't care about religious differences and think about this: it never has <unk>
When I sing songs from our childhood, trying to talk to words that I couldn't even do -- it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel she's 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that he went out every single songs of my iPod, <unk> conversations that we maintained when I was four years old, <unk> <unk> in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
They don't seem amazing?
But most people don't.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case -- even though that was the case that it could only mean one thing -- that it could only mean one thing -- that were autistic and autistic people.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In each individual manifests itself in a different way, that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of the development of the development of the development of the development of the higher development in the world, there is no cause no <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new person in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in their own world, with their own rules, and he found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting the cars in line around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that was <unk>
As I grew up, it becomes more different, and the differences became more <unk>
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the hyperactivity <unk> had something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature -- a kid who saw the world without <unk> a human being who had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change for normal.
<unk> happens to the beauty that give us differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could get a single thing to <unk> and to Sam and you would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside and honestly, the search for normal, is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change is dies at the time where we try to be like others.
Please. Don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what must have been to be <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me a teacher of communications, which gave me a kind of communication to graduate students in engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> from these students with their great minds, their great books and their big, unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> should have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
Just as I sat down when I had those conversations with students, they surprised me the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking the largest challenges from energy to the environment and health care, between others, and if we don't know about this, work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
So let's ask why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that they study the <unk> but study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing their science, carefully <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of his ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> affordable is not the same as making them dumb <unk>
Instead, as Einstein said that everything is as simple as possible, but it's not simple.
They can easily communicate their science without engaging the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, and analogies and analogies are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting her work, forget about the signs of <unk>
So you've been wondering why they're called <unk>  What do you do <unk> bullets are killed and <unk> their presentation.
One <unk> like this is not only boring, but it supports too much in the language area of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective -- it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that actually inspired the only one of the Tower <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphs to our other senses, and they create a deeper sense of understanding of what they are <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help everyone else open the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the Oxford English <unk> <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
There was a <unk> editor of the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is the one that looks for a public <unk> no matter whether or platform or beginning, and that, when he wins, I get it by the mere use of monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something that I do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the foundation in politics, and that all of the politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was thanks to the courage of a guy with the famous name of <unk> <unk> who confronted the <unk>
They put him in the Torre London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> as the <unk>
Most of you think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that they might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk> by State <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them simply wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even with it they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term.
And I could have <unk>
Everyone got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
And I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and I was always <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of landed against the <unk>
The House House didn't want the Washington <unk>
They didn't want to call him King for if he did him or his <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate <unk> that came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. I did not invent the title. There was just existed before, but it was only meant <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take you seriously with a bad title and <unk> by <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my all-time favorite, to where I could figure out the Senate has never been <unk> the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep in there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measurement is <unk>  <unk> possible for us to keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and with this -- is that the title of the U.S. President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to note, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of flying vehicles and so on.
reality and history have been in the title of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
<unk> their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was an uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the <unk> 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate the Senate won and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one is going to be able to feel humble when you say they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to make a way and control reality, but really, really changes a lot more the words than what they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 at a feet underground in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that they talk about, but most of all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones are <unk> with primitive. tools.
Like the other one, I carry a cheap flashlight of light -- she strapped into the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can hardly tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that drops up a hundred feet on the ground.
He took my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met days before, who lost control and dropped 3,000 feet in that well.
As I talk to you today, these guys are in the deep breast hole your lives without paying and reward and, often, dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 continents in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO that has led to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and actually, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was existed in the world, but not in the grade.
When we finished talking to me very <unk> I honestly was <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days, and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> the stomach and, weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these sites.
And I even considered it my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are now over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much of Africans displaced during the whole of <unk> <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars today.
But today you can contribute to entire families in entire generations of <unk> <unk>
<unk> slavery generates profit from more dollars -- 13 billion dollars a year across the world.
Many of them have been driven by false promises of good education promises and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in most of the world, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, all sorts of family families -- <unk> in a heavy <unk> of <unk> secretly mechanically ventilated ones in their heads up to 18 at the time, and all of the furnaces were going to be hundreds of feet.
<unk> by the <unk> and tiredness work in silence, doing this task over and again for 16 to 17 hours a day.
There was no drink to eat, nor to drink, and the severe <unk> made you pee out pretty <unk>
They were just the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was next to me quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And it explained to me very clearly to show emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not citizenship in that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for its release and trusted and trusted that I would imagine.
As long as me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, in the Himalayas, I found children carrying stones for miles per <unk> <unk> to trucks waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than children who have died, and the children would take them into their heads <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
Do you have nothing to do with it.
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> <unk> <unk> their houses.
When you hear the word slavery often we think about sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness -- that would be difficult for me to work in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women that had been previously <unk>
They lead me to the <unk> <unk> that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as it's known as the craft, they're local <unk>
They have small rooms -- private rooms -- where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of the only seven years -- they're forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each <unk> it's dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their customers.
On the <unk> I remember a <unk> <unk> fear and, in that instant, I could barely imagine what it must be caught up in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where he <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no big windows for <unk>
Those people have no <unk> and, since you touch a very difficult topic, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual trafficking.
There are hundreds of people in the agriculture, in restaurants, in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as a sex slave people.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were whole family families in the trade of silk.
This is a family.
The black hands of the black are the father, the blue <unk> and red <unk> of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk on the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is toxic.
My performer told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, be able to go out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay us to our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen family on a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids, some younger kids, right?
<unk> were all slaves.
The children are separated from their <unk> families who were forced to work on these boats in the lake, despite not even how to swim.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to the subject -- I was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by fear of falling to water.
The branches of trees plunged into Lake <unk> often catch networks and children, and with fear, they float to the water to unleash the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to run away and, like all life has been treated with <unk> <unk> it tries to the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they <unk> the latest networks, but they had been working since the one in the time.
On the cold night and <unk>
And I'll point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met it in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will be because somebody decided to make a difference in their life?
<unk> for a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with her suddenly accelerated and surpassed our car and touched the window.
They asked us to get it on a way of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed out this kind of visible path and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started to go down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the team from photos on my head as they were <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> the road ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field and all of them were full of enslaved.
A lot of women had children strapped to their backs and, as they were looking for gold <unk> in waters of <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember watching his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have to be 90 feet and these people carry these stone heavy bags that then will be transported to another area where they were <unk> the stone to get the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer, on the side of the close, you see other less lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this <unk> victim and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, his uncle took him to work with him in mines.
When she died his uncle, you will get to hold the debt of the uncle that the force will be a slave in mines.
When I met her, he had worked in the mines 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so great doctors say it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it is forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he was going to be liberated and <unk> with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility -- which inspires me a lot respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will have a testimony of them and we're going to do everything possible to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see each other as human beings, then it makes it very hard to tolerate <unk>
These images are not of magazines. They're from people, real people, like you, who deserve the same rights, dignity and dignity in their lives.
There is no day to happen I don't think about these beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images will wake up a force in those who can see them in people like you, and I hope that force will turn a fire and that <unk> light in slavery because, without that light, the <unk> beast can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do the mathematical math, and there's a peculiar problem for whom we are, we are like the <unk>
No one knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see later on.
But the classic demand is a degree of extraordinary training -- a high standard of dexterity and probably certain initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's disorders were able to gradually this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a virtuous medical <unk>
In the last few years, it's been a lot of progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an weakness <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know whether there's a cure to be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement -- there are no <unk> That's why they don't serve any of the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of the clinical trials, you never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test for ourselves?
They don't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want you to think about you as a very conventional way to try, you see, in some sense at least, we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vibrating strings.
It shows someone healthy as it makes sounds when we speak. We can imagine as dancers of a vocal <unk> because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes for example.
And as the <unk> requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about it as a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal chords as a <unk> and the Parkinson's is affecting the <unk> also affect the <unk>
In the bottom tree you can see an example of <unk> <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
shake <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with the clinical clinical trials -- well, they're both <unk>
The neurological IQ is not <unk> both the existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole range of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but also the exams based on voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're at minimal cost, and we all know what happens is happening.
When something takes to be so <unk> it appears to a mass scale.
These are some amazing findings to get <unk>
We can reduce the problems of patients.
I would not have to go to the clinic for <unk> <unk>
With high <unk> we could get data goals.
Could we make it a massive <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Women's <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have affordable lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, <unk> can call under the price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.  Tom Rielly: So let's take all of these samples of, say, 10,000 people will be able to say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease.
<unk> You can see, some people may not be able to do it. You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data that's happening in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion in search of the real markers of disease.
TR: You have an accuracy rate at this point?
Much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works in the mobile phone network too, which is going to take a 99 percent precision.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max public <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, he made <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We fall into the darkness, in rooms without windows and generally we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models that are still more <unk> the perfect skin -- we do the impossible, possible and we were <unk> in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of experience and a real taste of images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were going on in Japan.
Little while later, an organization where I was <unk> there was the place that <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the feedback team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting in home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13th of May I traveled to <unk>
This is a little fishing village located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The level of water had reached over 24 feet high, and over three kilometers of land inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
<unk> rubble from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. We removed the mud and we left the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of tons of <unk> <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found photos and <unk> <unk> and chambers and <unk> cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of the peoples of around to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As he was fleeing the <unk> and to save their lives, they had to abandon all they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of <unk>
It helped clean up the hot bathrooms -- the enormous, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until beyond the same self my horizons something happened.
When you look at the photos, I found some that had more than a hundred years -- some of them were still in the lab in the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to <unk> how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started filming the photos.
This was the first of all.
I was not too <unk> but where the water had been <unk> the face of the girl had <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise that little girl would not have the aspect of her itself, and that would be so tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time they came up with a little bit more and more <unk> and they needed more <unk> and so I went into Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a people to North <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the cave libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, and it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour. It could be <unk>
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using a guide of the areas that color and detail had no <unk>
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures that are collected in fresh water covered in bacteria, with algae -- even with oil -- all of it along with the step of the time I continue <unk> and that's why I was going to run out of a big part of the project.
We couldn't do the picture unless it was clean dry and it would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We had <unk> <unk>
We have a <unk> of a <unk> neighbor
It's very easy to hurt even more the photos already <unk>
As one time <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky to the photos.
And I had started to <unk> her itself, but he stopped at realizing that the <unk> even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not be <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in one picture and <unk> the whole picture.
When I picked up their pictures shared something of their story with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the pictures at a fire station between the rubble of the rubble so far from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would <unk> it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Her children, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
He took a week to find all his family and knowing that they were all survived.
The day I gave her her pictures his youngest son was 14 years old.
To her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could come back to look at, something that could not have been marked on this day of March when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had been attached to where hundreds of them were helped to clean up to <unk> over <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the great majority went back to their own <unk>
More than 500 volunteers all over the world helped us to return to 90 families out of hundreds of photos totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend more of a thousand in teams and materials, most of us in ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one relationship, somebody loved it.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would wear but the first thing we would take to look for.
This was the project, of restore small pieces of humanity, to return to someone with the past.
When a picture like this gives somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected to something larger, I'll give you something larger, using their talent to something that are not safe models of perfect skin.
To finish up with this electronic email -- I sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I was able to avoid thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular photo is a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the little girl, <unk> about a baby, and I was <unk> because a similar picture of my family -- my grandmother, my mother, I and my <unk> daughter <unk>
In the whole world, all of our basic needs are themselves, right?
Thank you.
Doc <unk> we were inspired by awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on an exhibition just one <unk>
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I give you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create video in a slow camera from light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-ray and challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch on and <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in a number of <unk> to create a package of photons just a millimeter <unk>
And that package of photons is going to travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common.
If we took that bullet and this package of photons and fire in this bottle, how you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What's the aspect of the light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coke did not have this research --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a photons <unk> which starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we start to see these <unk>
A lot of photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air <unk> bubble inside.
At that time, the waves travel through the table, and because of the insights in the top of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that thoughts are <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> and we make it go the same distance and we see it slow down to about 10 billion times, how much think it would lead us to see that movie?
A day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film  from a slow movement.
And what about testing with <unk> nature.
You can see the waves that were <unk> from the table, the tomato and the wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I think, from a <unk> at once, but of course, our eyes look a full composition of composition at it.
But if you look at the more and more of this <unk> you'll notice that, as the light gets rid of the <unk> they are still brilliant at all.
Why? Because the tomato <unk> and it bounces on its inside and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to touch it.
Why do we create this camera in the <unk>
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture of it down to the low exhibition, it goes into a little light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest show -- so I'll just get some light.
We <unk> that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data into crude raw data and <unk> in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, they can become invisible,
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You could go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could get those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We have already built.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall there's a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a little tiny fraction of photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, at a slightly different moment.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good resolution resolution and can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects but we don't know what point it corresponds to what a distance.
When you project a laser <unk> you can record a <unk> picture, which you see on the screen, really doesn't make any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like this, tens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Can we be able to see it in it.
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this in the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's around the <unk>
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected out of open windows in the open window.
Or could we be able to be able to see the inside of your body by using <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and blood this is quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new game of visualization to solve problems in our next generation.
Just as Doc <unk> he was a scientist, it became science in art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all of the data data that we collect every time is not just for scientific visualizations but we can see that we can be able to.
So create a new form of computer photograph with a slow and color code and color code.
So let's look at those waves Remember, the time between each of those waves is just about a second.
But here is also a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order that the events happen in the world sometimes come up with the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone, your life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime of humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and it would be famous.
This is all possible with a mobile.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to be looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people <unk> that they would be looking for a change, they had a cell in our pocket.
Who are a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile phone, and how I changed life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 different lines of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every single telephone company <unk> every single Internet provider has to store a broad range of user information range.
Who calls to <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All this information is stored at at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or his Internet provider or the Internet.
And in all Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and the Internet providers, all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, <unk> priests, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets in Berlin and they said, <unk> don't <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> that at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, and please get all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to them, and I didn't get a concrete response, it was all the <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to do a demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of the end, I agree.
They need the demand and they will send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court failed <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly part of brown with a CD inside.
And the CD was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> <unk> <unk> of information.
At the beginning, I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the <unk> means.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in and go ahead.
You can see every step I have.
And you can see how I go from <unk> at <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a bit of fear.
But it's not only about me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call it between them.
And then one calls the other, and the other one to another, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how people communicate each other to what time they call each other to each other, which time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks with who, who sends an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell in our pocket.
And <unk> had known that who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin <unk> might never have happened.
And as a result, neither is the fall of <unk>
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within and outside the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives, and they want to <unk> it forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to tell your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value, and it's not <unk>
When you go home, tell their representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information store of you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that give them to you to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hi, <unk> what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi, <unk> what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I've got cerebral palsy, and that's why you spend all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus, from my mother and not <unk> because my parents were all for the siblings, although they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that came up at the birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of them to be there.
I feel bad for me, because at some point of life, you wish to be disabled.
Let's go for a walk.
<unk> <unk> are in the shopping center, drive in circles for parking lot and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they're thinking, "God, can I be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There was an gold <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I am from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same early ones.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in no puede" moment.
The mantra of my father was: "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three younger sisters <unk> I was <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents would get to the school system and <unk> that I was also out of it, and if we didn't take all of the ultimate note -- the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at five years putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another point that I used was to hang up a dollar in front of me to get it to it.
The <unk> that I carry in was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion which has received a lot of taps.
It was only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and you still have all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think right now to use <unk> to the <unk> as a campaign.
The people that I grew up with had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be <unk> a lot that died of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating, so <unk> of dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't pay physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> whatever I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to <unk> me as well.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't coming.
I was spending my summers in a war zone, because my parents feared if we don't go back to Palestine -- all the <unk> we were <unk> in <unk>
On the summer holiday often, my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk of <unk> I got warm cups warm on my back, and I remember the water <unk> and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I thought <unk> <unk>
But the bold cure was yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before I do yoga was a <unk> comedy that I couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can get it on the head.
My parents took this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through the positive discrimination and I got a scholarship for the <unk> University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like <unk> pet in the theater.
I was all <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the top note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene of glass of glass my teachers <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in <unk>
It's a play of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> In order to have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end of the end of the end of the <unk>
Thank God <unk> I'm in the end of a <unk>
I didn't get the paper --  <unk> <unk>
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater department in the theater, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask her why and she told me that because they believed it couldn't do the risk scenes.
And I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the stunts you can't do the <unk>
It was a role in which it was literally born and gave a actress without cerebral <unk>
The college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors for disabled papers.
And I came back home, and my first <unk> <unk> was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that directors of <unk> not <unk> no white, sustained disability.
It's just giving people perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, he took comic comics from New York to New Jersey and never forget the face of the first comedian that led when he fell at the way that he was at the high speed of New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little nasty rumor that women are not fun, and they find quite fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and at the time I remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the stigma for disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program for cable and it has Keith <unk>
And I went into a dance dance, I went to a study and sat in a <unk> wheelchair.
And I looked at the director and I said, "Excuse me, can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clinging to the <unk> desk so not going out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew I wouldn't go to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> came back to <unk> but I got as a full-time participant and pasted my chair.
Something fun that I learned in right with Keith <unk> was that the people on the Internet are <unk>
It tells you that children are <unk> but they never get rid of me or a little girl, and even larger.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
I would find clips online with comments like, "Why <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my <unk> <unk> terrorist <unk>
What disease has it?
We really should pray for it.
One <unk> suggested I even would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make it <unk> then <unk> can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
And the doctors said that they don't understand, but I'm here in front of you.
However, I have grown up with media, but I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all of society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in a representation of the great state of New Jersey in <unk>
And I started <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me work, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This people are close to <unk>
<unk> drives the small people to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there's no opportunities, no job, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you read about a gentleman who offers to take it to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives a break.
He gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes to send home to her family.
They show a young lady.
Finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a bomb car.
That child from that little village with the dreams of the great city was the <unk> bomber and that dynamic group of people were to the <unk> a terrorist organization in the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little kid in a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting for.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that he arrived.
This was the first thing that took him from what we call the <unk> <unk>
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young unemployed of unemployed urban urban riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of work, of well-being, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities are under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they are not <unk> opportunities -- the story of <unk> <unk> the door to access to terror, to violence, to the <unk> to be the story of resilience.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent isn't working at school.
They don't quite do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being at that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I'd been forced to be forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
It would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor some youth leaders at a business peak.
They were going to go through 90 juvenile leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had a rainwater on the solutions to the great challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There were no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me that because he was a college college college <unk> frustrated, was the perfect white white for Al <unk> and other organizations terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to point A to the B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
It started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10.
Why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate <unk> and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
They give young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of entrepreneurial initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years ago, and until Mohamed <unk> if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from all over overseas.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw <unk> flowers.
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer becomes, <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
He created a farm in the outskirts of <unk> and it started to grow <unk> and <unk> that he said, they could survive the <unk> climate <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding and creating gardens in houses, and the companies of the city, and now it's working in the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, the children, can go together, and as he says, smell the <unk>
By the way, he's not <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact in young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
They encouraged to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They were bringing business solutions for local problems.
So then inspire young people and create a entrepreneurial spirit culture, it's really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation to guide them into the development and put in their business.
They ask young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from conception to creation, and will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her <unk> <unk> this is how it's called, when it's created, to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their innovation <unk> and you will have more stories about flowers and <unk> <unk> than <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> Mountains in the <unk> <unk> area in New York City state.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was making the leaves <unk> as a <unk> and not being on the way that we were able to pretend we were the first human beings on step on the ground.
We arrived at our camp.
It was a shed a shed in a <unk> to a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they had thought they were going to clean up their <unk>
So that question went with me, and it was <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where do you get the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, and the reason of 11 tons of waste and two tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know how individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and she walked through his routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a little bit more <unk>
So I started working like <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And <unk> <unk> mechanical and <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong you would be quickly <unk>
It costs a lot of used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still attached to the weight of bringing over their body tons every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
Are you coming out and coming into traffic all day and <unk> around you.
They just want to <unk> so usually the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And the crap itself is full of dangers that are often fall from the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the trash of the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It always has to be moving.
And the stigma.
I think the stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste is the most important labor of the city streets for three reasons.
They are the first license to public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste <unk> and it effective every day, this starts to <unk> from their container and their dangers inherent we would threaten us in very real ways.
Control we had controlled for decades and centuries <unk> and they start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of how old we don't have space for what the engines of the economy start to fail when it's endangered the consumption of the economy.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just put your relationship.
And then it's what I call our average speed that we need.
So with that, I mean, just at the speed that used to move in the time <unk>
We are usually not <unk> or <unk> we cleaned up or we took our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know there is a job force on the other side that it takes out of it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and put it into that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when it is.
And their work allows us to do ours.
They are almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us safe from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow always has to be left in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection on the street, grabbed my little son, and he went down the stairs and he went on the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of paper <unk> as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing this particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be right.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that, I began to investigate the waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together many times and made good friends.
I want to believe I was right.
We're going to be right.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we should include and have to account for all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor.
<unk> <unk> what we think about when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the amount of waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing to see someone whose job is to clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that we showed as example, to my team and me, what we had to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many of these buildings in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to run a lot of energy because the transit system generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this shouldn't happen because it's about a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the entire year.
And thirdly, what it looks like has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a bad place of a place as rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, he was actually captivated by the old market that is this structure to the free air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought that was what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of various stories by applying these principles.
So the next challenge presented to you to survey the site, which is located in an area of much growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, don't exist in the image.
And there is also between two streets in parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entries from the building.
And this extends out with an <unk> <unk> that creates a space in the <unk> building in the building that was governed by its own way, of the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would get to the local <unk> conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue similar to a concrete <unk> <unk> to allow the entrance to the air, and also in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way you controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it was not what they were.
But finally, we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center because of the end of the commercial center, there were more local to sell.
And the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to glass, but also because it was no need to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where the electricity gets almost every day.
So we got a big advantage putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which together collect water for inner power.
It's waiting for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction floor.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the bigger that I am, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in the <unk> -- a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of access to connected lines of water lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the streets there, creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we choose some key spots in relation to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little media cell, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So I added a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to them?
And it also responds to local rules that set up a higher density in higher levels and a lower density in the plant floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as <unk> to the community that was occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can you get up and <unk> and do such a <unk> for two kilometers in the morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities to literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes to local communities and the local economies at the same rate of buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that have like objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was so remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had a very bright hair and a little <unk> of <unk> <unk> it was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year, and I was full of <unk> until I had my sinister plan.
One day I got a time after a school <unk> I was a little evening and I hid in the bathroom <unk>
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher grades.
And then I did.
I would take the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few percent.
All the same thing.  And I set up to give back the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my fellow colleagues had really good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes all over the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows out of <unk> and I was just a row of it, just for being there, because I was <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never got <unk>
It was that it was that it was that it was that it was that it was all <unk>
I would never get <unk>
But most of all, I'm going to tell me the reason why I was bothered by this <unk> so small, was so good to <unk>
Will the jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause one of arms murders in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that observe loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction -- because novels are like the lab in which they study <unk> in all of your possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's a exaggeration to say that if there were no <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There was no king <unk> no <unk> and a <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
<unk> the reading lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> no <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No <unk> I know it's fashionable to say <unk> has the answers to everything, and in terms of the <unk> almost that has all of them.
This year they were about 100 years of their work -- "In the time we have the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also from the <unk> <unk> -- all we could possibly have.
We think of a kid trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how <unk> it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as a cat.
I don't know what the cat <unk> is, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the <unk> that are reduced to the person to be given to their <unk> they are a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being at the storytellers as storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details to you want to nail the knife <unk> right?
<unk> make us all of novelists <unk> and that is something that they <unk> understand.
Everything that she makes to give me pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool <unk> that <unk> detects in his lover, it adds to his collection of instruments of torture in their private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> get rid of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the big <unk> and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> get rid of the photos.
So that's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links the language of <unk> <unk>
When you <unk> it is in their agony of <unk> at the time listening behind the doors and <unk> to the <unk> of your lover -- then honeybees are the behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're scientific research with real value value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> are <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search of truth to the truth, of the truth, and the most agonizing the truth is better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, that makes us suffer, causes in us a much more profound feelings and vital feelings than a wise man that could be <unk>
We're telling us that let's go to search for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> are reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us open up in this <unk>
Is there any other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at is so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife was born.
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, that he didn't get away in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under <unk> without any cause.
But he was looking for things that had his wife, without realizing it.
<unk> <unk> or literally, <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
novels are really good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> make us look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And because of this reason, I think, <unk> us to make violent acts or illegal acts of <unk>
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me for the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from Michigan of 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account of a Facebook account from which they were sending awful messages to itself, for a year.
For a year. A whole year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend, I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with awe.
Because let's be realistic.
How huge as it happens, even if you need creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel by Patricia Schroeder
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who are trying to do the <unk> <unk> and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> is going to be <unk> or want what you have to get to the <unk> of being and <unk> from what you ever heard, and it's under the floor. <unk> your name takes your <unk> cow bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all over the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
That is, we are good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
novels show us. I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they are to a mystery.
Let's go to the Baker <unk> <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always said <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> face of <unk> <unk> who needs to <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> at each of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in the <unk> of the Six <unk> -- once you walk in, you walk up, <unk> all with their solution, <unk> <unk> <unk> and says, "We are not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him that there's no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't like to get your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> it was taken in the story, and I find this very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat them as a geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you are on the same side.
All of a sudden <unk> is able to admire that idea of being he <unk>
It could still be so <unk>
What if <unk> are really a geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, we remember that we have the fiction.
The only fiction fiction, jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> them to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the terrifying Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the very Marcel <unk>
We are in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside the <unk> <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sea of the <unk>
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence in the gray surface is the culmination of a collective process of <unk>
The Apollo program was the largest mobilization in the history of the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave work to 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They were killed, including the Apollo of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo Apollo program, 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> <unk> on his surface, of which fled after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't brought a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the eyes of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some ask, why is the <unk>
Why do it turn to our goal?
And they could also ask, why is that climbing the most <unk> mountain.
Thirty-five years ago, why would fly over the <unk>
Why plays Rice versus <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> Apollo was not just a victory in the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of technological <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> Alvin in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with candle -- but in 1969, the Apollo Apollo crew flew 40,000 miles an hour.
From 1970, no human being turned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the <unk> crew of Apollo 10, and the most optimism of the technology has been <unk> to see that the problems we imagined that technology will solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure the cancer, or to feed the world population appear to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the <unk> tube of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I could see the colonies on Mars.
So that belongs to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard that for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have <unk> and they had enriched with trivial, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've <unk> and enriched our lives.
But we didn't get the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> who have been created by less ambitious companies that are <unk> from the years when they were <unk> and Microsoft, and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are <unk> in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk led to the creation of ideas <unk> by funding for problems -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even though the risk venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about risk -- they preferred small investment, lower investments that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with the benefit in technologies as a energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is in the long term.
No, the reasons that we cannot solve great problems are more complicated and profound issues.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because the political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from energy sources like solar and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic <unk>
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and the oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want sources of alternatives that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, business and economists agree about what policies and treaties <unk> the development of energy <unk> <unk> a significant increase in research and development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we will see an energy policy in the U.S. or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seemed technological, they will not be.
We know from time that famines are the result of failure on food <unk>
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and food -- but there will be massive famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1971, but we soon found that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found themselves effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we have to have -- but these four elements of being <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions have to support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it works with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there is no popular design mythology like exploring solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And actually, I wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Okay, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> ideas <unk> that have a lot of trust.
They are so common that they've become <unk> in our society.
I think that's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, it's a very general belief -- it's a very general belief in it.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First <unk> why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I will turn to think that there may have declined in some activities or institutions and that might have grown up in others.
I have no clear.
But I can go to <unk> polls and opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has <unk>
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were involved by 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, keep inspired by the same <unk>
And the people who were very trustworthy about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> as adults, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway through the street.
But that's this evidence enough?
What opinion polls are, of course, opinion.
What else can you get?
What you see is the attitudes attitudes that people exist when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> at the teachers of <unk>
Probably asked to ask the question, "To do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but on other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit the confidence <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> officer or <unk> is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give the kind of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my youngest friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have gotten those evidence in our everyday lives in the way trust is <unk> why we stop side all that knowledge when we think about trust in form more <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they are trying to <unk> the good inherent judgment of trust in something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
This is not that goal that I <unk>
I tend to have more confidence in what is <unk> to trust, but not what it isn't.
And ultimately, I'm <unk> not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who would raise their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. Madoff, that then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> <unk> that's the right goal.
Once you say, yeah, yeah, yeah, it means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about doing is to make a judgment of how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust her, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but they don't <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends that are very confident that they can do certain things, but I see that they will get their own <unk>
And I'm really happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we're going to be <unk> to have before trust.
trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've been trying to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, professional officials and others, that make us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
A lot of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once he was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that I will be <unk>
And we found the same problem in our public life, and we found that the system of accountability is destined to ensure the <unk> and the testing tests is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You may all know examples of the same thing.
We get all of that for the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we are going to be worthy of trust, and we will tell the people that we are reliable and if we were trying to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- which doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, in short, is <unk> because they give up other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give you the bases enough for you to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> all of people, all the time.
But you also have to make sure that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That gets a day every day, and it makes the common people, the <unk> institutions, very well.
I'll give you a simple example.
The store where I buy my socks is that I can <unk> without giving intelligent people.
I take them and get me back my money, or they change them by the color of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're going to show is not really hard to <unk>
What people rely on is the relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the early computers of computers -- we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly moved to more and more and more, to such point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a glass screen and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started imagining what it would be.
First of all, I created this tool that is <unk> in the digital space, so when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body at the evening.
The designers can engage their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs.
So with this tool, you break the barriers.
But the two hands still remain outside of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with the digital information using the entire dexterity of your hands?
In the division of Sciences <unk> with Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little bit of space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
<unk> a transparent bombsight with chambers deep to detect the fingers and the face, now you can raise the hands of the keyboard, to get into the inside of 3D, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and the files have a location in real space, <unk> it's so easy to grab a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or words with the tactile tactile sensor that is down on every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
We would have a lot of us would have bought and thinking about things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make physical physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future be?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator, <unk> Post, we create this only physical <unk>
This imam <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And in the digitally programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and will reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach you physically and at distance and the famous <unk> <unk> <unk> can be reproduce as a physical reality the times that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts as the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike the monitors or text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without that we have to move away from our world.
We started the talk today of a barrier, but if we discount that barrier, the only limit that is left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to join a school to athletes with all expenses spending.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
Then to survive the Islamic Revolution believed strongly that there was only an interest way towards <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter if I work or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera singer
This was me in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start to <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of school and the <unk> of a radio show.
But any adult gave them the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends, my friends, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream will never be <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class would be the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me wanted to <unk> OK.
Tell the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in 1995, and what were the first books to do here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not propaganda for the <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a theme for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find the meeting with a new culture also led to my architectural reading.
We had a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map was out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I'd never happened, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not a new thing.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
We have to research camps like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers to academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading was working on research, why not do it in life as well.
So I started reading books.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> <unk> are economic <unk> and spiritual <unk>
To Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and the duty of Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Alan <unk> instead of being lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> mother." <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people of the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I was alone or <unk> ever.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that dreams come from, where the passion, where it comes from.
Even a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named Alex.
Alex came to the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> dropped on the sofa of my office and took me off the shoes and told me he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a first client.
And I had a <unk> who wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the sessions, it became easy to move the head while we were trying to fix it.
<unk> are the new <unk> saying, Alex, and what I did, she was right.
You start to work after that, you have children later, and then death happens after.
For <unk> and I had time to take a while.
But little later, my <unk> <unk> me to press Alex and <unk> to talk about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Yes, it's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "No, still no, but maybe they go back with the next.
Also, the best time to work on Alex marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people sit on the head after what they were doing, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a break.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only to Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk> all over the place.
There's 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that no one comes to age without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! All right.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> they take away from the dream one <unk> I want to see. All right.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the 35 years.
This means eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that they give to your life have happened for when you have 30 and <unk>
People from 40, you don't go panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
And we know that the brain ends up with the second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> to <unk> which means that if there's something that wants to change themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality is actually changing more times during its <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that the female fertility gets to its top to 28, and things become complicated to <unk>
The <unk> are the time to get it on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which his everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical time in adult development.
But this is not what you're listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the time line of adulthood.
The researchers call the <unk> an extended <unk>
The journalists called the <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the adulthood.
<unk> Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and you say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person to the sense of urgency and ambition and nothing happens.
And then every single day, highly intelligent, interesting <unk> like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this <unk> <unk> I'm not just killing time."
Or they say, "All they say as I started a career before the 30, all be right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I was better risking the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts going to sound like this: "My "My <unk> during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all going on and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, the music broke the music and everybody started sitting in.
I didn't want to be the only one who was standing, so sometimes I think I was married with my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds kind of true, but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's an enormous amount of pressure to the <unk> and so many of you will start a career, choose a city, to choose a mate, and have two or three children in a much smaller period of time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts to show, which is much harder and hard to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle <unk> crisis is not about buying red <unk>
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want to do now.
You realize you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you doing?"
I want to change what you're doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At the 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having a identity.
He said he would like to work in art or the entertainment, but I still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, it was living with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living <unk> very difficult, his previous life had been even more difficult.
And it was very often in our jam sessions, but then she woke up her as she would say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got her head over his legs and <unk> for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent all the morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he got to see the empty space that goes on after the words in case -- please call me <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I get <unk>
At that moment, I had a lot of work to resist and not say, <unk>
What Emma I needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as I worked with Alex as just sitting while the decade <unk> of Emma went forward.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> or female, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma who is <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> capital of identity.
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is a investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I do know this: capital capital creates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to try to prove it.
I'm not going to look at the <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that should not count, which, by the way, is not exploration, which, by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma to explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I told Emma the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the talented ones that get together with friends with similar minds are limited as long as they know who you know, what you know, how they feel, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who gets out almost always comes out of his nearest circle there.
The new things come from what they're called weak bonds of friends from their friends.
Yes, half the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half is not, and the weak ties are the way we can bring it to this group.
Half of the jobs that have ever been created <unk> then meeting the chief of your neighbor is the way to get a work out of it.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
For the last but not least, Emma he believed that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma soon she was going to go to his family, when she has a partner and it has his own family.
I told Emma the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better to sit on your head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook start walking towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before we <unk> it, and that means being so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of only to do or kill time with anyone who is choosing to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a quarter of a cousin who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak force helped them get a job there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with the living thing.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married man with a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I sent me a letter to that saying, "Now the emergency room spaces of emergency room are not enough.
The story of Emma it may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like airplanes that come out from Los Angeles, who go somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fit in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21, or to the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years, or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading all of the coolest ones that know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell Alex.
This is what I now have the privilege of telling architecture as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their <unk> get their <unk> to use their <unk>
They don't know what they didn't know or what they didn't have.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management consulting for a work that was even more <unk> <unk>
I was to teach you mathematics to the medical students, in New York City.
And like any teacher, I used tests and tests.
I gave it tasks.
When the work comes back, he <unk> grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones who had a better performance had no <unk> I.Q. scores of I.Q.
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things they need to learn in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts aren't impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way.
It's the <unk> but what if you're successful in school and life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn <unk> and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of <unk> scenarios.
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
We are trying to predict what it would be <unk> in military training and who is <unk>
We went to the National <unk> <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to be able to do in the competition.
We studied teachers, working in neighborhoods, really hard neighborhoods, which teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the more effective at improving the results of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, which of these marketers are going to maintain their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, one feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it was not I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to reach very long term.
<unk> is to have <unk>
<unk> is clinging to his future, day after day, not only a week, not only for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not at all speed.
A few years ago, I began to study the determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to make my <unk> determination and then waited for over a year to see those who were <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had dramatically had higher likely chance of graduation, even when they were <unk> in each aspect that I could measure, things like family income, the results of evidence -- even the security results in school.
So it's not only in West Point or at the National <unk> <unk> where <unk> <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little it knows about the development of it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How can the purpose of <unk>
What should I do to teach kids a very solid ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who simply don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination often is not related to or it's even related to the <unk> measurements.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is a idea that was developed at Stanford University, and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and need <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to start to start to start everything again with the <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters <unk>
From that moment, I was going to be asked by this incredible language.
But for foreign it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that whatever you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learn to learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I began to learn how to draw each of the strokes of each character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You only need a thousand to understand basic literacy
The first 200 will allow them to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read the telltale traffic signals from restaurants, to understand the basic idea of the web pages or newspapers.
Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as you could until it's <unk>
They get a mouths.
This is a person who's going to go for a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if they were screaming <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> this symbol of reality is <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> <unk> in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they create more characters.
One person.
If someone walks behind, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are crowd.
If one person stretches their arms, this person is saying, <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a wash as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a speaker speaker is quite an idiot.
Do you remember <unk>
Two <unk> together, it gets very hot.
Three glasses together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and bright moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun comes over the horizon.
One door. Put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> had someone at home?
This person is coming out hidden from one door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, it's <unk>
So we've already spent 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little <unk> they will be able to learn a couple hundred <unk> which is the same thing that you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the <unk> we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning -- because Japan is in this China.
So a sun is next to begin with Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked over the other.
In the old China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and <unk> from the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film was the imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and carrying a magic wand, and I'll wear a magic wand, and I'll wear a magic wand, too.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of a kind of industrial <unk> of a child fantasy.
However, the Oz magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took rise to 40 years later with, oddly, another movie whose <unk> a metal kid and a <unk> kid would get a girl who was dressed in a girl who was dressed in the <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician magician is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling prophecy.
<unk> shoes to defeat the <unk> generated by evil evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician of Oz is that the most conservative characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to see this when I made "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Just three years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small to that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had been <unk>  And so she was in the room and he was impressed as a mom and he was impressed as a mom with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be the themes of value, <unk> and <unk>
It would be a sense that Luke <unk> a army to <unk>
And we had this with the magician of <unk>
How do I win Dorothy his movie?
In doing good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It is the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to be <unk> OK? And not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why are there so much capital capital F, in movies for our children, and so little on the way of building <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence movies, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
Now, I know the experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first bit, I think at the time of the first quickly, I really expected the guys to come out because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they are, the kids are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend them against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend out of the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war <unk>
Of course, the most successful issue of all times, it continues to happen in classic after classic <unk> each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and two men who raised a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, it finally came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Do you remember what the critical criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not its roots and <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book <unk> and in the <unk> of the 1980s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of the movies of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> In the movie, there is more than a female character that has <unk>
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something other than the guy than you like it.  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women that exist and they talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the movie we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality film, <unk>
Right? <unk> de <unk> success -- a sense of consensus of what a Hollywood movie movie is.
<unk> is not the test of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in a embassy where men and women hide during the crisis of <unk>
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the arguments to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go back in the numbers.
In 2011, the most popular movies -- how many of them think they have <unk> <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women that we have recently chosen for Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a bigger number that this is going to be going to take away this room.
Last year, The New York Times ran a study that the government had done.
This is what I said, like, this is what it was like, <unk>
In the United States, one in the United States, one in five women says that it's been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's <unk> of mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I think music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics one of the things that I think is there is a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero, is to defeat <unk> <unk> and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We're <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very startling <unk> and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our willingness to <unk> <unk> and we hope that we will be able to ask, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power forward.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of the box is changing radically.
You will have read about how the new economy is changing the role that you care about from the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite character was his favorite Star character from "Star <unk> Do you know what they were <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What's in common these two?
Maybe it's not just a brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help us to achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want to do less stories where I tell my <unk> Go and fight and more stories where your job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to better improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a girl, I was living in Maine and one of the things I liked was to look at sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, with the time, I was fascinated by <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of nearly 1,300 kilometers of length.
And my sea biscuits had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew it had to do differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the place, to simple sight, seems to be brown, but when we use the infrared -- and we process it using fake, suddenly it looks like a brilliant pink thing.
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes in landscape caused by the building materials and the activities of ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we have used satellite data to find an old town -- old <unk> called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the ancient capital of Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of ancient art and <unk> architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this massive <unk> <unk>
This area is huge -- it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find it at random -- it would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So, we use NASA data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly elevated that looks inside the circle here, that we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians who are doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the sample of it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, underneath one layer of <unk> we find a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location, five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years coming back from the Middle Empire -- exactly the same period that we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> jobs and <unk> what shows that there was a <unk> shop there.
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think of the most common stones that were used in the jewelry, of the Middle Forest -- these are the stones that were <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a jewelry jewelry shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we're going to focus on a very close future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also do great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire -- it was probably written by <unk> 3,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually really started in 1984 BC.
It certainly makes the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to just close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that's made.
Now <unk> a group of obese <unk>
They are competing with a bicycle <unk> race and go in the direction to your front door.
I need to see this <unk>
They're <unk> <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of your house.
There are bikes that were flying everywhere, wheels that go on their side, rays of the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the door, the door, the door, in the door, and the bottom of the door.
And look at the lobby, or what goes on to the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse.
They can feel your blue <unk> you can tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you go to the point of getting into the mouths.
They go through a side and enter their living room.
Already in the room, and making the maximum use of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
There's a little bit of clothes, dancing on their center <unk> singing <unk> -- One <unk> <unk>
Now I went to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a little bit of yellow bricks and from the oven, come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that is done every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> of <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> waiting, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers, looking at them once.
They were using the names of tens and tens of strangers.
I spent whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he was able to memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one, it's a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the best <unk> memories.
And I said, "Well, when you realize that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
I actually have an average memory.
Everyone involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
And we said, "We have trained us to do these miracle acts of memory using some old engineering techniques invented two and years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and <unk> <unk> used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside of the competition of the competition and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English -- he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
Do you know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> live on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and which can be their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a problem of <unk> it's amazing.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows you to see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> he was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went through one afternoon in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And by coming back, he gave him a number of treaties on memory -- something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time where this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined memory -- it was not one thing as rare as it can be like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory.
These techniques have made our modern world, but we also have changed.
They have changed, and I would say that we have changed the cognitive too.
As we almost don't have to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of <unk> memory and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of University researchers in London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to have brains in some way, or structural <unk> of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a battery of cognitive test battery, and the answer was really not.
There was a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the ones of the control of control with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI machine, <unk> your brains while <unk> numbers, faces and shapes of the snow. They found that in the memory champions to become different parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or they seemed to <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament in competitive <unk> is dealing with an armed race where every year comes up with someone with a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of competitors have to get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk, front of him, there's 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he's about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and just he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
In average hour. Yeah.
And while there's a lot of ways of remembering things in these tools, absolutely all the <unk> techniques at the end of the end that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It is illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox -- <unk> <unk> says this: I say to two people who remember the same word, I say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's his name.
And then I'm asking you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them, <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
Ask you what a <unk>
The person who was told that his name is <unk> it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told to be told that their job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the ultimate name, actually doesn't mean nothing for you. It has no relationship.
With all the other memories that dance for their head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They do well when they come back home to work.
You probably know some <unk>
And when we got that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point later on.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back and a half thousand years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
History says this: There was a poet named <unk> who attended a <unk>
They were hired as entertainment, because before before, if I wanted to give a very good party party, he didn't bring a <unk> he was going to give a poet.
He stood up, <unk> his memory poem, and he was <unk> and so soon it was the classroom of the <unk> <unk>
They come to everybody.
But not only killed all of them killed all of them but shattered the body <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were <unk>
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He stopped standing out the single <unk> in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting in <unk>
I took the family of the hand <unk> where they were their loved ones between the <unk>
What we <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we are not good to remember names or <unk> numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual and spatial spatial memory.
If you ask me to tell me the first 10 words of the story that I just tell you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet, if you want to tell you who you were sitting on the horse <unk> brown in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and <unk> images with things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago to the first <unk> memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it of memory in the same way that he would have done it, if they had been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine coming into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce Ed <unk>
And then you'll see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they fly in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they talk would be that strange journey that did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how the speakers <unk> <unk> their <unk> not word for word, which is going to confuse them but typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people were thinking about <unk> and in rhetoric with this species of spatial terms.
The <unk> phrase would be like the first place in their memory palace of memory.
I saw this was simply fascinating, and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring event.
Really, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting on taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone got off the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning before I sat down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school school school <unk>
And I discovered that this was fun.
I would never have hoped that I was going to have it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is really about doing is to make it better and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really hooked up with this.
This is me, using my standard team training for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of safety covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a competitor of memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could be able to do a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's cute <unk> <unk> and phone numbers, and <unk> <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are so only tricks. They work that work.
Because they are based on very basic principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on.
The palace of the <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
And we had a kind of deep processing, a kind of deep attention, which most is not going to be hanging out there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, this is what the <unk> <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, and I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks into our side will be so <unk> that we don't even want to process in processing in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are amazing memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the guy who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It is a complex thing, so we had just <unk> just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and she lived there in my parents' house in a town called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, since my bedroom, I was the toilet that sharing with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there everyone spent the time looking at the television -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, I all looked at me and every time I got <unk> and I would come back in a <unk> all of me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> insecure and hated it.
<unk> that journey, hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, nor division of areas, but of those emotional <unk> connections that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under their roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about that because in a building built two two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> who uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long time for a long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build museums in art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
People who are doing the <unk> and governments, they always have to fear innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he's got a <unk> it has this round and a clean brick red, and they leave <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> children, history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, got another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So what is possible in the same year in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that are constantly bringing new technologies, new new solutions for life forms today.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> so far away from the people.
All of the black, this is <unk> you think we are really good, but we're dead in the inside because we have no choice.
We need to go to the other side and go back to connect with those <unk>
So we do this, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experience the pendulum back to go ahead and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago from the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the <unk> <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Something really really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those forms that we know and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a little bit of new materials.
They love it.
We don't give them <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we converted them into a divide that can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
insane.
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those lives could be <unk> to French or <unk>
And maybe with an infinite bit of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy -- they're easy, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started to swing the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we began to experiment with the <unk> <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> we now have new design techniques on a computer, and we find out with new <unk> some forms that are being involved against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You get totally <unk>
Normally the pendulum approaching the opposite direction.
But then something happened.
In 1997, he opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said Bilbao was one of those rare moments when academics <unk> and public <unk> were completely agreed on a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> construction.
The tourism in Bilbao has increased a thousand percent when they finished the building.
So, all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wants one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first <unk>
But how is it possible that these forms wild and radical, how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media went around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
Same thing was done by the top mayors in the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the new millennium country with other African architects here.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened to these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to happen with all of the architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think of it, for example, how they use architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
The transport is <unk> they can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, all of us are photographers of architecture, and the building gets beyond its physical location.
The architecture is all right now; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast as quickly.
It's not quite accurate enough to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings, before we know whether which I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find ourselves with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen to happen. Because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> of steel or an elevator.
My theory is that when it applies to media, the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until you will be on both extremes almost in <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make a little bit of <unk> symbols of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York City state.
It's a holiday community.
But that meant that two years before the building, it was already part of the community. And as the drawings looked like exactly the actual product, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a means of communication, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that one made of the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative and that makes the collective memory -- and by bringing these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need Greeks to tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but that have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building builds up today, first <unk> to the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell you that there is no unique response to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experiment.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that are using words <unk> and drawings and kind of complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> public that doesn't embrace anything before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it for architecture.
That means that the pendulum pendulum <unk> from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different to the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the extent of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red brick based on ideas of what it has to be a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage garage in Miami to Florida, it can also serve to do a sports or for <unk> or even one can be married at night.
This means three architects can <unk> in the East New York City in New York, and to raise half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, no one customer alone.
It means that any building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that go to observe.
Because no matter if it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we have.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> and more intelligent buildings.
We've been waiting for everyone to you.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings are not just reflecting our society, but they shape the way to the most <unk> spaces, local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it makes it a great way of a great way of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is <unk> in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
<unk> and <unk> and it gets itself to himself those big <unk> and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And I think, "When did I stop doing this?
How is we suddenly not <unk> with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google -- "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be loved and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
Among what his mom tells him and what his friends, or colleagues are saying, doesn't know who to believe.
So a video of her itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has gotten more than 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a <unk> and <unk> teenager who gets these answers into one of the stages of their most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going on to do this?
Well, the teenagers of today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, <unk> so young.
As a mother told me, "This is how there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from the hand with that is <unk>
This environment, of being always connected to our children to <unk> and based on the number of people who have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There is no division between life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what it is <unk>
What is the most prominent thing in life in front of what is normal in a context every day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> of the girls right now.
<unk> size are still dominating our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And the trends like, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who are <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But kids are not immune to this.
<unk> <unk> and singers, <unk>
But what's the problem with all of this?
Well, we surely want our kids to grow healthy and be very good individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we are teaching our children to spend more time and effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capacities -- their studies and other aspects begin to be hurt.
Six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for growth as human beings and as <unk> to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one out of three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> discussions that participate in the classroom arguments, because they don't want to call attention by their physical <unk>
One of each five are not coming to classes at all during the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you see it well, specifically if you don't think you're fine enough -- you have a lower note of your fellow people who don't care about the average of your fellow people who don't care about the appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, America and China, the U.S.
And it turns out regardless of what actually weigh these young people.
So, to be very clear, we're talking about how you see you, not what you're like.
The low self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-esteem do do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, engage in more diet not healthy that they can take you to a mess of food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all for all of this for what makes decisions more <unk> like alcohol and drug consumption and drugs, aesthetics, aesthetic surgery, aesthetics, sexual and no protection and damage.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're <unk> again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
Fifty percent of women are not presented to an interview interview on one day where they don't feel safe in the way you see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would be that <unk>
<unk> this potential is interest to each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> the first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really amazed when I learned that many programs <unk> without realizing the situation.
So we must make sure that the program that follows our children are not only going to have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are key points for anyone willing to provide a education in your body self-esteem that works.
One education is fundamental -- but to deal with this problem requires each of us to take charge on the subject and be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
I challenge the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to have the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people by what they are, not as you see them.
And all of us can start doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you when it was the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as and as companies, to change our culture, so that our children will grow up to be valuing their whole person, to be valuing the individuality, diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
So let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them go out on the big screen because we can only create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never going to be able to be able to be who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have your mind?
They <unk>
They <unk>
They <unk>
His <unk>
It could just be the woman who is two car seats, what would it mean for her if it was released from that voice <unk> in her interior, he was going to read him for not having long legs, <unk> more skinny, and more <unk> feet <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were doing this and we would say it has his potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are attached to us all.
But let's take our kids to the truth.
And so I think that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for who they are and what they do, and because of how they make us feel.
It empowers self-esteem in our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And working together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year of today, will become agents of safe change in themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On November five November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the British <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
They were initially told by initially who was innocent him, but being caught by other high charges -- on the company of others, they started planning attacks at about 12 of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the bottom of the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans were taken by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the 1993 of 1993 in the World Trade Center couldn't afford it.
Later <unk> would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, as he was an engineer who had a loving mother with a <unk> mother teacher in high school teacher in the two of them made all of the possible possible for me to give me a happy son.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims get to know.
So I saw that when people take time to <unk> you don't need a lot to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in every human group, there are always a small fraction of people who are so charged with their convictions that thinks that we have to use all the possible means so that they all lived like them.
A few months before he arrest him, he sat down with me and explained to me that in the last week, he and some friends, had been going to launch in Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We came to the <unk> <unk> that we didn't know our group, I was filled with the FBI.
When I got my father <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to aim about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet he shot -- I gave the little orange light on the goal, and to surprise all, especially me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such child.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. but only a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting a <unk> <unk> in the underground parking lot in the northern tower in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and <unk> to another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved away 20 times. That instability during my childhood, not allowed me to make a lot of friendships.
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone was already <unk> and going to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class I often was a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white. But it will be the new of the silent class and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time was going on in reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not have developed social skills, to put it <unk> for <unk> it was not prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in test my way of thinking, was during the 2008 presidential election.
In a <unk> program, where I was involved in the National Convention <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt very much about passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the convention, I found out that one of the kids who had made friendship, was Jewish was Jewish was Jewish who we did.
I took a few days to come out of the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I'd never had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had been made to believe that he was <unk>
Another crucial moment came up when I got a summer work in the Bush <unk> an amusement park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
And I had a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I was able to see that several of them were the simplest and less critical ones that I'd seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it was not easy for me to do the kind of class people exactly the way I wish to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is to be homosexual but I know what is to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then he came up with <unk> <unk>
Every day, Jon Stewart asked me to be honest with respect to my <unk> and helping me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure on a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes inspiration can come from the unexpected, and that a Jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something that keeps in my heart forever, while it's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy needs to keep all of that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
I changed it when my family decided to break the relationship to my father and start a new life.
So why should I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone, one day, who is trying to lead to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better path.
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do this for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak against these meaningless acts as <unk> to the actions of my father.
With this simplicity I put here as a proof that violence is not inherent to religion or race, that children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that is projected in your minds.
It's an incredible movie movie.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your movie is colors, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, and anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of childhood that project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths about the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an inner movie -- you, tea and you.
There's nothing you know more directly.
At least I know I have an <unk>
I don't know that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we have to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows answers to those questions.
<unk> that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective is yes.
<unk> by nature, is subjective stuff.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all of the 20th century, it would make that vision.
The psychology of psychology studied the financial behavior, the neuroscience of studying the human brain, but never one thing never mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something of this kind of fantastic work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of looking at faces or feeling or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of job of neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they do with what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
I don't offend the <unk>
There's actually no easy problems with consciousness.
So it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is it a <unk> internal movie.
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> as the <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk>
The standard <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how they operate <unk> how they work <unk> how they are adapting and <unk> and <unk> are all questions about how it works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how do we figure out how we were playing <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem, the question of why is that all of the behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have to say.
I'm a heart scientist in heart.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I was beating my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that wasn't working for <unk> reasons.
I think we were going to get it on this point.
We have a wonderful explanations -- great. We get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate to our worldview in the world, but we don't know yet how.
With one anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that were at the beginning <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for these crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Her crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of our inner subjective film, includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what we need to do, is to explain the functions to <unk> the behaviors of the brain, and this is this whole thing that needs to explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of pure consciousness <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for a lot of others, that vision is quite close to simply denial that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I go in a different direction.
In the time that left -- I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, and the mass.
We get fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and properties and properties are not explain in terms of any more basic terms.
Instead, they are as fundamental as principles, and then you build the world.
Sometimes the list of fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain electrical phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts of space, time, <unk> law, and then I applied the basic laws of <unk> and I applied the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws.
I think that's the situation that we find in consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas and space, time, <unk> <unk> then for a matter of logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect the awareness with other fundamental concepts or the space, the mass -- physical processes.
physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws that we can get them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws that we can get them into a t-shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all of us, <unk> in mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs, the dogs, flies, even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when you think <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thinking is that perhaps photons can have any <unk> <unk> if you have some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How would anyone think something so crazy?
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental, like space, time and mass -- is natural to assume that it can also be universal, like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, that's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind looks more like a continuum with nature.
One deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that we think of thinking with the physical process is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information processing, there's consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as a human being, complex awareness complex.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed it <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a measure of behavioral integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to be able to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a degree of information integration of information, just quite significant, degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to <unk> microbes, you particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
It actually provides a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that the <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk to us about the reality underlying reality.
Like Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
So this vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to address our relationship with nature, and it can have a very serious social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I had nothing to eat nothing to have a conscience, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> you take that vision, you'll get a lot of hunger.
I think we thought, well, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information -- she has an complicated information processing, so the answer is yes, if it's aware of it.
If this is right, you have a very serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of development systems and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of <unk> the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group as the audience at a TED Talk, at this moment, we have a collective collective consciousness for this full set of TED, different from the movies inside each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that has to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer from the very crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those little bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't expect to solve it overnight.
But I think we finally will be able to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village at Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a very normal profile.
I went to school, I joined my friends, my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a prize in the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's an obvious problem.
She actually hasn't gotten anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had an underwater profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series.
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as an achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the middle class of 11 studies -- a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when you're going to be <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> <unk>
When people on the wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the <unk> classroom.
And it was when I realized, this kid had had disabled experiences as things of inspiration.
And we don't have it, and it's not the fault of the boy, that it's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there for <unk>
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you, right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we have lied to the disability.
Yes, we have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> <unk> capital <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you remarkable <unk>
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't do <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without the hands of drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call porn inspiration here.
And I use the porn. porn term, because we would get a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we were giving them a chance of having no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, why are my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that I've been talking about strange <unk> to express that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my job had a public profile.
It was kind of like me to get up in the morning and remember my own name --  And this is <unk>
These images, those images will match people with disability with people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
So let's make some things.
But the things we overcome are not the things that you can think of.
They are not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was called the social model of disability, which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society we live in that because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very pleased with him.
It makes the things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the commons.
They are simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So that's really fair to be <unk> in the way we do, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lying, because we've been sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here -- the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything inspired by something.
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> from other disabled people at all time.
However, I didn't realize that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to load the battery out of the mobile phone in the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance.
I really believe that that lie that you've been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us life hard.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that is lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles to a stretch of stairs has never done it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> in front of a TV screen, won't be going to appear.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> is not seen by being on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we will be <unk> by standing in the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child from 11 grade in a high school in a classroom in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think is to know about it that you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and football <unk> with the <unk>
And what's the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I just respond to one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think actually <unk> you think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because reality needs to change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> Google Glass.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will engage with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is running through the field of play 160 blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a 110 pound man, and we were trying to do it with all of his being.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
I took some videos to show you what the Google <unk> is using the helmet, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not the images of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine climbing up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
One of the time. I was a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the field of <unk> from the perspective.
You may have realized that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, be their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how we carry it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many people already know.
<unk> <unk> has described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not a cheap thing.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in a Russian coaster -- it was <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you get a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan experience.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> by throwing the ball into the bottom of the network?  Or it was <unk> by making an <unk> <unk>
What will be your experience when you fall out of a mountain to more than 100 miles a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality augmented the <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win.
So here's a brief basis on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore had a <unk> to their <unk> <unk> to make it play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put in radii in the <unk> of the field of the field and after the defenses.
They were more fast, because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to your group and you see your next couple you show in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on in front of you -- you don't have to worry about losing a <unk>
Or to memorize the strategy.
They just come out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose them and they hate <unk>
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your play to play the game.
How do you do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the sensors of the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information comes to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones will have information overload
This is going to give the good teams of bad equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being just to nerds.
It will also be <unk> Who would be <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that they're the field.
It takes the ball and <unk>
<unk> a open receptor. All of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight is <unk> that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Usually not <unk> but the system of <unk> <unk>
They will get to the protection area.
Another <unk> will you tell you that there's a open receptor.
Do you get the <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where we land, but the receptor sees in your bombsight an area of grass that lights and can modify the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The silver <unk> and the fans have followed the stick of each angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the game.
So I'm going to do lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport, because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this is the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use reality <unk> to foster the empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is literally going to be in another person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
What is this technology for a gay technology in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it is being <unk>
How much for a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes.
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality gets over.
The questions we make, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as well as us.
Thank you.
I was recently <unk> after 23 years of service in <unk> <unk>
Most of those 23 years of the country <unk> the southern tip of the County.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to the beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for the suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The <unk> bridge had been opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer, chief chief engineer.
suicide from the bridge is no practical or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to death from that bridge.
Some of you think that traveling between the two towers will lead to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as well as the each of your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a <unk> for five to five seconds, the body strikes the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bone, some of which will make vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
The ones who don't normally get rid of the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that those who are going to be able to get this method of suicide will realize the death of death that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people get before they were able to get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the bottom moment, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day in bringing it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal <unk>
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who were born, the suicide, but the officers too.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, officials, veterans and psychologists train to train the new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met this by 22 last year when he got a call from a possible suicide bomber sitting in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I came here, I looked at Jason talking to a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown up to here two times before from New Jersey to try <unk> from this bridge.
After about one hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story about the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and I sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came up with <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped some <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind of clever guy in New Jersey had just been able to get to life.
I spoke to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, my family rabbi called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason had asked the order.
<unk> damage from suicide affects a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved outside out suicide behind.
What do you get?
<unk> what do you say?
In my experience, it's not only to talk about, but you need to hear.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like, because you probably didn't get it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think about someone is <unk> you don't have to be afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end your life, you've had these <unk>
You can save the person in front of you can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believing things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there's nothing that you can do to the <unk> social isolation and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read to you his letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote me this email just a couple of days, and he's with her permission and <unk> who were <unk>
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking you should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you leave a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but seeing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of the 49 feet with his father the 19 of January.
He never got there.
I called the <unk> <unk> and I called it like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported me that the car of Mike was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump out of the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been prior to not suffer with a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be that easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go through the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote a radio call for a possible suicide bomber on the sidewalk <unk> near the north.
<unk> my bike. on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the hour and the next half one, I heard like Kevin talked about her depression and <unk>
Kevin decided that he says that day back to that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin turned into it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did it happen to do, and he would tell the hope and the life of life <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I'm <unk>
They stopped me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events on the 11th of March and you're one of the reasons Kevin with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
He's been diagnosed with a mental illness that has been properly <unk>
I heard Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know it.
Kevin in order, as it says.
Let's thank God for you.
<unk> <unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she write, <unk> When I went to St. Hospital.
I knew I had it <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father.
It talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story will inspire others.
suicide isn't just something that I've found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> <unk>
That act, despite the end of his own pain, the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider the suicide, you wouldn't think of hurt someone else.
They just want their own <unk>
And therefore this is achieved only three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls from suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke about an hour.
For that time, I was getting my hand at three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
It was absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few people who have jumped from the bridge, and they can be able to talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that they leave next to the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that all of us and each of us must use it to do.
Food can prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but inside your inside you know what you are, and a question <unk> How did you become that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone, not any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I was finally achieved that I had had a little bit of a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner interior, with my inner self.
So for complicated reasons, I will go back later, when I look at this picture, I think, you get it up -- you know, <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that I was beginning to start.
We were all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the constraints imposed by the color of the skin or by the belief that around us.
They are people who are always challenging the status quo -- which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent, even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> by birth to the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines at my house, I was always wearing this shirt <unk>
And my mom asked me, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair -- I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
Gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and mystery <unk>
Because of my success, I never helped to share my story, not because I thought to be what I'm bad, but because of how the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mother and dad and a family who will embrace me as I am.
Many aren't so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a Hindu goddess <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage, and I remember this beautiful woman in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me, this is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the CEO of a <unk> beauty.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she died, she got rid of the <unk> and <unk> and the night, and that night, I won in a bathroom, I won in <unk> and was a <unk> <unk> among over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was the queen of beauty of women, but I can do it.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to <unk> <unk>
But more important than that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. He had moved to San Francisco, called me and told me that he passed my request from the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was hooked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you get to the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I was two <unk> to my name.
She was also accompanied by me when I was <unk> in Thailand to 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the rural cities to do the most sophisticated surgeries and secure surgeries and secure.
At that time in the United States, it was necessary to have surgery before changed the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and the <unk> of <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears was <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
Many aren't so lucky.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living in his truth, but that <unk> <unk> her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
Every 20 of November we make a global <unk> for the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who are <unk> and stood up before injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my living alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others to live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there is no longer <unk> from 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Are you going to do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. All of all, thank you to thank all of my <unk>
My network of supporting my parents in particular, to my family, which itself is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me that their parents couldn't accept it, I took the phone, and he said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it works, other don't. It's just the identity of gender, that's what's at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we were all assigned to a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the topic that sometimes that assignment is a little block, and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be a space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. All right. <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when their efforts were involved in 2011, to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> became very famous -- a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality of violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies, right from the beginning, when I was born a girl, their birth is born, and their birth is <unk>
It's not healthy, not by his father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood comes, he gives her <unk> to mother and nobody else <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot for a little girl.
When you give birth to the first girl, the first daughter, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he was <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty of a criminal.
Not only the mother <unk> but the daughter <unk> <unk> when it grows, he suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays at home and school admits of her brothers.
Until the age of 12 years in a way, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, you prohibit your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of your house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the honor of her father and her brothers and her family, and if you were <unk> the code of that honor, honor, it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this <unk> code is not only about the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of her sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more standard of <unk> societies called <unk>
A good girl is supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and that accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and people's decisions, even if you don't like.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with an old man, he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk> from <unk>
If the very young <unk> has to embrace it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
What about the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson for his daughter and the same lesson of honor to their children.
And this vicious cycle goes and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, I felt extremely <unk>
And so long before I was able to think of her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> from <unk> and I called my daughter like that.
But when I was <unk> all of them were men, and I grabbed my pen, and I got a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she came out, when she was four and a half years old and a <unk> in my school.
So you might ask, why should I mention the <unk> of a girl in a school?
Yeah, I must <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in societies in tribal societies, it's a great event for the child life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of their identity and his name.
One <unk> to school means that has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when you put the form of <unk> Canada, and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written on no document.
That was the reason why value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
<unk> to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to get it on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I have <unk> all of these good values in my school to girls and kids alike.
I used education to <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, to women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation from women in all of political and economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and I was terrifying to have these people who kill and <unk> when you talk for their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the 10 years, <unk> got up and raised by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, <unk> she'd been offered her himself for the New York Times, and I talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It's <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and nine of the October of October 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I read her to my wife to my wife -- "I must <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> told me, "Please, don't you <unk>
They get the right cause.
<unk> your life in play by the cause of truth because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right path, and God <unk>
These very few words <unk> for me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was held by the face of my wife.
But my daughter has never been <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to get good. Please do it right.
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist at the hardest moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any 16-year-old girl.
<unk> when he didn't end up the task.
They fight with their brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special in my <unk> who has done so audacious to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I mean, I'm not wondering what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion for me.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the Google <unk> <unk> where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work I'm going to talk about here about the science of the brain, I did it before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain surgery.
You are still like smart or not?
Don't be like that, you can be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to make, more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I had nothing to die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to <unk> them to follow life.
More than I've saved my little bit.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that we will try to get the <unk> in the <unk> because there really doesn't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started trying to try <unk> and I was shocked by looking at how small changes in the top dose, dramatically my sense of who I was me, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case <unk> for a few months, I proved doses and chemical chemicals for a twentieth man, and I was surprised by watching my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in the sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several types of things, or maybe some versions of the <unk>
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that it wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit of <unk> to fix a problem that had to the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't manage it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and what they have to do -- since then I get better with men.
What it was trying to do is that these hormones and those hormones and so on, was to recover my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thinking -- my flow of ideas.
I used to think about it almost in imagery, and that became my key point of reference -- how to deal with those mental imagery that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> looked at things in the same way.
They thought images and ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who ask this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental imagery are fundamental to <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I could find the point right now, and I have a lot of great <unk> mental <unk> you really get very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take quickly these mental images, of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director was able to use your imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There is incredible possibilities with this, like the way people creative can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that are made by two groups that are made in neuroscience.
They both used <unk> technology, image of functional MRI, to represent the brain, and you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The column in the middle shows the scanning of the brain in that same individual as you can see that same image.
The column on the right was created by <unk> the contents of the central column of the left. You see the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine seeing that same image is <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were taking their brains to create a great pool of brain reactions in the brain video.
And then you showed them a movie with new images, new people, new animals, and as much as they took a new <unk>
The computer using just the brain information data scanning it to show what it looks like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're very close to it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same picture, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the brain scanning systems of the size of the larger resolution today, and its resolution per thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you <unk>
There are many techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce it.
I don't offer me for that.
A lot of people are proposing -- new projection techniques for images, even I -- <unk> with the recent result of the <unk> we first need to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get more resolution is with larger, but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer small improvements in the resolution -- not increases by thousands of them as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of the bigger magnets to make better things.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different dealings -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make really big magnets were to make really large, right?
However, most of the recent breakthroughs in <unk> of clever solutions and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in humans and receptors in the MRI systems.
At once, instead of a magnetic field -- <unk> magnetic magnetic patterns in the frequencies of radio frequencies <unk>
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of radio frequencies patterns -- we can increase the massive information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I've mentioned and perhaps even the neural activity of direct neural activity.
Will we be able to put our ideas into a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool for amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few options more than open this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
His closet would probably be telling some person for the first time they love it, or tell someone who is pregnant, or to tell someone who has cancer, or any other conversation that you have through life in life.
So everything closet is a hard conversation and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it to happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side of the South Side, <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through various stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, quoting <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be slope by the <unk> of my pants -- and I was going to get my head through a little bit, I was asked by a little boy, "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And there'd be uncomfortable with the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take me with a coffee <unk>
The father was <unk> <unk> the newspaper and he had a cold eyes look at his son.
But I would never say anything, and you get it into it.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it came back.
"You are a guy or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time I was prepared to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And so I take it deep down, and I went down and I went down and my back a 12-year-old girl with a pink dress with a little dress looking at me looking at what is not a challenge for a feminist <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a guy or <unk>
And so I took a deep back, again, I stood up close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something troubling.
I have the short hair like a boy, and you see a kid, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a <unk> pajamas.
All right, I'm more than the kind of a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. I just say, <unk> you're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the hardest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl from the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you a hundred reasons why to get out of my closet was more difficult to get out of it, but this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's hard to be hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who have declared <unk> <unk> is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that the story is more difficult to say to your seven-year-old son who are going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's only a hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult to do with respect to another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to only feel empathy because we all live in a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least any more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live in.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse, and a dress and <unk> shoes of <unk>
It was not the militant lesbian prepared to fight any four year-old kid who would go into the coffee.
I was frozen because of <unk> <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay <unk> and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing I ever have.
My family, my whole strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world turned back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't throw that <unk> you kill.
One of my memorable launches was on my sister.
It was the first time that many of them were born between the guests who was gay, and when my Lady <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came up to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew me was a few years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women was going, <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in St. Petersburg.
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your TV show.
Our program Will Will and Grace and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in waiting for desperately to show his support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk> shirts, <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find out and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing to do.
That's how hard conversations are still my strong point.
Ask any of the ones that I have ever met.
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it means is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> the <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the other ones you need to know that they will also be <unk>
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they are gay, <unk>
If they say their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that might change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  quit the complex.
You communicate your truth.
I would never get rid of that.
And some of them can go out alone, you get safe, <unk> for what they've done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but they didn't share them.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that you care about is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you might feel very themselves, but they are not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of what intelligence has been the famous <unk> quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism to the pioneers of computing as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we would put a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's get a step back.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from a space that you don't know about the biology of the Earth and the Earth of Earth or intelligence on Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can look at the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept on Earth intelligence on Earth, you would see it forced to develop a physical theory that explained how to a moment in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And that's why I claim this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I studied a variety of themes through science, through various disciplines, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be down, adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, to the development of universal states that will create the diversity of possible future diversity.
Finally, in <unk> <unk> there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize future freedom in order to do complex tasks.
And so, taking all of these different themes and <unk> together, and I asked for a number of years ago, there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're looking at here is an assertion that intelligence is a strength, F, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a <unk> force, with the diversity of possible future <unk> Yeah, to an impending future, future <unk>
In short, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain the open choices.
And so, having in account this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
It <unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> the <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have to have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence and intelligence is more <unk>
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually arises directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system where you find inside.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to go through multiple animal testing, play games -- play games, and even win money <unk> actions, all of it without the fact that it was going to have been doing that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for humanoid robotics and human <unk>
This capacity of tools will be applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling opposite lengths of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of that task model.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
So for example, here we see the successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
Here we look at <unk> <unk> new connections into a social network where the friends are constantly constantly getting together, and it keeps successful the network right together.
This same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we look at <unk> organizing the routes of the boats, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to extend on global level to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems for <unk> and transportation and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> they will spontaneously discover and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a series of negotiating <unk> that will increase the assets under their biodiversity management.
This risk of risk management will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of smart cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation, all flow from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom to action.
Now, here's a deep irony.
Let's go back at the beginning of the <unk> the <unk> work, there was always the concept that if we were able to build smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be <unk>
The machines will be held against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all of the concept of rebellion -- to the other other way.
It's not that the machines first become smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take the control of all future potential is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence that intelligence can actually emerge directly from taking control, rather than the way around.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
I often ask me, how do you look for goals <unk> from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants of helping them build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, is the following: intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are at a point of inflection in human history, something between the empowerment of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how the Earth fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope, which measures the faint light intensity of stars when planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light coming to us.
The data gathered by Kepler show the sizes of the planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their mother.
In all together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that gets from their <unk>
Instead, this is clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for us to have been disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused on a global scale have been rapidly <unk> our ability to disrupt their ability to disrupt it.
But I'm not a weather scientist and no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, hoping to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in search for life in the universe can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered and the planets that we know -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world shown by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and partly it is why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> track its surface in search for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the atmosphere and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Business is now providing not just short space flights but also the chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images are, we remind us of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked into our imagination with <unk> ideas, and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain <unk> places in comparison to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and more <unk> of Earth the air is cool and full of oxygen attached by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I'm worried that this excitement about the colonization of Mars and other planets will get to a big and sad <unk> the implication and the belief that Mars and belief in some that Mars would expect to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly livable the Earth.
So I like to like this exploration, <unk> I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will be more late in the <unk> of the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for climate exploration and conservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They only find them closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment experiment.
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, when we realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider to live between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of the planets that we <unk>
It's arrogant to think that only <unk> <unk> will save us out of ourselves, but the <unk> <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to <unk> the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where he had <unk> them.
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all very closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least with my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I was <unk> from my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but it's sure that not more expensive than a <unk> at a night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I was very <unk>
I'm neurologist a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases your heart rhythm, and the <unk> levels and <unk> the thinking.
And when I came to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that I could put in his place, which would make bad things happen.
Or at least if you happen, bad things, you know, the probability of a catastrophe of all.
So I started to think about that, but to a month later, my thoughts did not.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who was a little embarrassed by the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him about I broke the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and he was Danny shared with me that I'd been doing something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written out of this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, and then try to figure out what can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so <unk>
I'm going to start with the obvious.
On the house, you get a place for the things that are very easily.
This sounds like common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the good, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the tribes are living with friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they were the <unk> sense of <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car, and reading and <unk>
So at home -- a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular <unk>
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and they are <unk> with that things will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take a cell phone -- a picture of your credit cards, <unk> passport, I was in the mail for yourself in the cloud.
If these things are missing or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there are perhaps not more stressful situation than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, that we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all decision-making decisions, and in fact for the decision-making and social decisions, any kind of decision that we have to take from that would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart stroke attack your brain injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard of the <unk> and you know it's one of the most popular drugs in the world today, you probably know that you know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that is supposed to ask that most doctors don't want to talk about, and pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a medication or to have surgery in any medical procedure before they help one person.
And it must be thinking about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number needs to be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not <unk> and if it's <unk> it's from scientists like me.
We have not understood very well the mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> which do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This according to the research of cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
And I am <unk> the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, or brain event or another event.
Now you might say, "Well, one probability in 300 to <unk> my <unk>
Why do not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everyone <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more, and it is <unk> from the <unk> effects, right?
For this particular drug, the side effects produced by five percent of patients.
And those include things that include severe muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, <unk> five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still taking the <unk>
But just a moment.
remember, under stress you don't think clearly.
So you think about how you look at this over time, so you don't have to make the string of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has saved five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug to help you medicine.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic required, is part of the principle of informed consent.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the end of the crash, but actually this need to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done by the older men in the age of 50, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
That's what it is, 49 surgeries for one person has helped.
And the side effects in that case, produce 50 percent of patients.
Those include helplessness or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about time before the questions you can argue that we will make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have a choice, many times, they want a more short life of pain, or a longer life that could have much pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can shift from opinion at the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they shut up a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face to face with a predator, you don't need the immune system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't respond quickly. They could be the lunch of the lions, so nothing matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thinking -- like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We all are going to fail to have then.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help to minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> at the night of snow in Montreal, when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a <unk> of combination with the door, with a key to the door, in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I have not <unk> and lots of text messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be -- you could never get a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the decade in 1800, and over the time they were mixed with local signs, and it was developed the language we know today as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and they taught me to believe that the sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sound, it's as if I lived in a foreign country, following the rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound one?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can make sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example.
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
Don't do a lot of <unk> to eat the bag of potato chips.
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, not <unk> the covered in the <unk>
All of this is called <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag than the average person does it.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> for decide.
They were going to go ahead and go on.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, I do whatever my thumb is that it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I have four lines in the paper.
In 2008, 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I'd worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, it was all <unk>
Now the sound has entered my side of art.
I'm going to tell you more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that not only experiences through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all that had taught me about the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like the money, the power -- the <unk> social currency.
In the background of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was something of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could be <unk> to me and my artistic job, or I could tell you it.
I chose that I was <unk>
There's a massive culture around language language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, to the eyes of society is like not to have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support like and become my voice.
I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with a lot of different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> his voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan with a very high interest.
If I'm not going to continue this practice, I feel that I could <unk> in the <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and fully express on the paper.
And the same thing can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much of the signals as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide into a lot of different <unk>
If you're mapping a different parameter for each finger while the facial expression, the facial expression, the motion of the body, speed, the shape of the hand and so, while the piano, the English is a linear language, like <unk> just one key at the time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in a position to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If only one key would change the <unk> create a completely different meaning.
The same thing is happening with the music in the way, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and it <unk> over and again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is all day."
If you put it up, and you <unk> the visually speed, you see as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said of <unk> <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance your body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer to and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea and a dramatic idea at the same time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> hand -- <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
Everyone on the hands of the hands.
Now we're going to do it as much in your head like his chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a <unk> is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please <unk> again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest. But they transmit very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have <unk> automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines the social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, no sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> no one to hear to learn how to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove of trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to get to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, you can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- because adults lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning each other.
The country, now I'm an adult and teach citizenship and invention in the middle school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait so much for my students to walk through the beach with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these great ships and networks, to collect these plastic bits to come up with the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and also it's too risky to use those huge ones.
So with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> work with <unk> so that the children very <unk> can be able to participate.
And I'll tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we slow down the size that we find in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I'll leave you with my students.
My job is trying to take the best ideas in every child and try to figure it into something that we hope would work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the children are very excited about the robots.
Then we created what we call <unk> <unk>
We're so fast at creating prototypes that we ended up before a lunch.
And it turns out and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> it into a floating robot that will move slowly through water and through the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating through the sensor as the computer on board processing this image and measure the size of each particle, to get a estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this step step at a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would get it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I was looking at my personal problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
You see the news, you look at the Internet, and you get rid of this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up an oil spill, just using the hands of the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> of the world in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that drink is the water where the water is going to be <unk> where they live the place where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown, the mud and oil also are brown color, and when everything is discovered, it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can spread through all kinds of substances that produce different features, which can help to identify what's in the water.
And we had this prototype with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to look at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help the other children.
I was trying to investigate a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he created a number of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> invaded various cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant to Fukushima, a nuclear station close to the water.
And today, according to the reports today, an average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and the most of the most part, it takes safe, it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I have come to <unk> every year from the accident, and I was researching some independent way with other scientists, the Earth, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course, not the <unk> the parents didn't get it.
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here is the use of different masks here.
It might seem that they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Along with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we create a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this, we were able to notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition, the closer to the nuclear power to date.
We zoom up to a half a mile of the nuclear station, and with the fishermen aid from the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem with a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been more frustrating and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of a small facility so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the largest space that's dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, of fibers, basically, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with the <unk>
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the old age transforming their standard <unk> chairs in new vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, citizens of scientists, <unk> we must make the next generation for people to worry about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically <unk>
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thing has imagined it.
One is designed by nature, the other by it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only a <unk> tool.
But living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we carry all of the information required for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has mastered by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained trained to think their objects as <unk> from different kinds of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One acts primarily like the filter the other primarily as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that changes gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my worldview in the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect and working in between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between Henry Ford and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and analysis is shown in the two screens behind me.
My work, at the simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world away from assembly and coming up to growth.
You probably ask you why now?
Why wasn't it possible that 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where you have four disciplines that offers designers access to tools we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scale scale -- like this robotic arm with a 24-hour scope of 24 feet in diameter with a basis that one day not very far to print <unk> buildings that shine in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every aperture is the unique size to model the form of light and the heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion <unk> -- it's like a second skin made out of a single piece, <unk> in the <unk> <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing 3D printing -- we print this layer and 3D skirt with no seams between the cells.
This hull combines <unk> and soft materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and <unk> instruments that are able to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair a chair at the same time, comfortable and also absorb sound.
The Carter teacher came back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
We put this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, changes your functionality not by addition to the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There are no parts of nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish home, but when I was a young man, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came up to define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a tree <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between <unk> branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land has made trees to grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk>
The earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design if the objects were made of a single part?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material of the material of the tree of the <unk> tree with fruits, and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produce every year for organisms like shrimp, or <unk> or <unk>
We thought that if we could <unk> their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> legal <unk>  <unk> a bunch of husks from shrimp, <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures -- this is built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could change the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made out of a single new material -- 100 percent recyclable
When the pieces are lists, it leaves it to find a natural form in touch with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to contain <unk> <unk> which came up for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria engineered to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without <unk> consumption to <unk> and if it extends even further.
A tree <unk> <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water, and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a <unk> structure from shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects designed to <unk> jobs in the sea, <unk> life -- and put on the ground, they will increase a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the ability to create clothes to keep the lives for the <unk>
To do that, we must master the bacteria and control their <unk>
So like the <unk> <unk> we made our own board table, new forms of life created <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new <unk> into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops.
In our first piece of clothes, you have two microorganisms.
The first is the <unk>
She lives in our oceans and in the fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human brain.
One makes light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces biofuels biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never get <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
In order to contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that resembles the vocal tract -- that will help these bacteria flow and make it <unk> its way away.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> more transparent channels.
This system <unk> <unk> when it stretches from one end to another, it's 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are a chance of fashion -- only half is <unk>
What if design is <unk> the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, and <unk> the damaged tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this a material ecology.
So we always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer printing material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do this.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of the <unk> for example, creates a highly inclusive architecture -- a home in which they were <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts like structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers into each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then it starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a little magnet to the head of a worm <unk> to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with MRI sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of the cocoon of silk.
However, when you put the silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we would take a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape of the composition, the structure of the <unk> <unk> directly by the environment.
Often the silk worms are to death within their <unk> its silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape the raw silk without boiling <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot <unk> and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk worms are going to be more dark and <unk> and that's why we use a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat out, distributes the silk worms over the structure.
We were prepared to get the <unk>
We tried <unk> worms to a silk farm farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to join us with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom line of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> silk silk about <unk> <unk> they give all this pavilion out of it.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> worms <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the path of silk.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full gaps.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us, to form a two of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, that leads to a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by the design of us, which demands us for the first time that we make care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they first asked this?
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English English and art and the art and the arts and the arts and the <unk> on a band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And I usually like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this sense of boredom, this thing of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I was going to tell me about something else, something totally different, and I'm going to get it into it, and I'm going to get <unk> and I feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because it wasn't sure how it was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my other passions, and <unk> <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad about me for nothing.
I was worried to be afraid of commitment, or being helped or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to get me back then.
<unk> themselves, where people learned to allocate meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they are, what they learned from culture.
What do you want to do is tell you what you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were going to do at that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in kids like, <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question takes us over and over again as we grow in different ways -- <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before the dream.
Why?
So if this question inspires kids to dream about what they might be, not inspire to dream of all they might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults.
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> and he's <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> publisher of magazine converted to <unk> <unk> teacher and <unk>
But most of the kids aren't hearing about people like this.
All they hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to be doing for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and a lot of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel that there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath for that.
It could help if you divide in three parts: <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can also be able to use other terms that will be <unk> the same idea, as <unk> <unk>
During the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was okay to lie in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
Do you feel any term you like you either like you or your own <unk>
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as a limitation or woe you have to win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in developing data, travel, mathematics and design, when he started <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates inspired jewelry.
A <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for its <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at the intersections.
It comes from the new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these points.
The second superpower superpower is learning fast.
When we got them <unk> we get to it.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be <unk> for being a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start out of zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and <unk>
As a girl pianist who had an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I become a writer, <unk> it was a <unk>
He had to learn the slower sales mechanics when they started their thumb, and this ability helps to write a compelling tosses for the editors.
It rarely is a loss of time to do what you want to tell you, even if you end it up.
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. That is to say, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes a director of videos, another designer designer book designer -- sometimes consultant of Kickstarter, sometimes a teacher, and sometimes, when James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take diverse roles depending on the needs of their customers.
<unk> Magazine defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes as quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to be able to meet the needs of the market needs the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning, and <unk> three abilities where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster the <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they're in your heart, specialists.
Look at their belly knowing what they wanted to be identical.
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong in you.
In fact, some of the best teams get up from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive into depth and put in ideas, and the <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we all need to design lives and careers that we think about how we are connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in a large part of them will be told to be more like your fellow <unk>
And once I said this, if there's one thing that you will take away from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner stream -- whatever it is.
If you are a heart doctor, then you go through all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those of you who just realize being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
Will the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring brings us into a happier and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, we <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman named <unk> they took a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until then, unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, he did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If you were <unk> I would have been living today, we couldn't give her more help than he <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's.
From <unk> medicine has advanced <unk>
They've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections, so many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral drugs for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it's a little bit of progress on Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million all over the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million people, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the chance to get Alzheimer's is almost one of each other.
In other words, there is the probability that you go through their age with Alzheimer's or help to take care of a friend or be wanted with Alzheimer's.
It's only in the United States, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent on Alzheimer's.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs of five times in the 2050, as the generation of the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical challenges and social challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't be able to cure or cure or even slow down.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we have invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research than in Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes an annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to one more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people know, but everyone <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few <unk> years, all of all, the scientists, get Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal part and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain in comparison with one patient Alzheimer's to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's and increased life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's had found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these dots <unk> you end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some of the points are going to be outside the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form great plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and the ballot identification is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that goes on and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of the wires have been reduced and waiting for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that blocked specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one outside of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick into each other inside of them, as humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive result -- but research like this sample that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to get that hope, to beat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to warn you that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we <unk> we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have topped more research and <unk> pressure on governments, industry.
That was essential to advance the treatment of HIV in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their dear loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not most of a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who cannot create the change they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and they will help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and from my own experience when I test it -- I was a night of the last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are <unk> to get over 36 questions and more and more personal questions, and then they both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> if you could wake up with one quality or skill, which would be?
Number one: When was the last time you go to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> These are more and more personal.
Number one: <unk> really <unk> me to tell your partner what you like from him, or it was very honest at this time, and I gave it things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I first came across this study a few years ago, a really kind of detail was really struck me, the gadget two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
But we were <unk> and I thought it was a good story, and I thought it was a good story, and I thought it was a good story, and I thought it was a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask, follow them together <unk>
And the reason I think they challenge this is because I have done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before he published the paper was very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had encouraged me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can come to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would have probably a few thousand views.
And that took a good burden of attention into a relatively new relationship.
But as we gave it no idea.
The article was published on a Friday night, and already Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And Sunday, I had been called the "Today Show and the Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage trust writing about our own experiences -- but another thing is to discover that life love of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people were called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they were always doing the same question: They still go together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the <unk> of my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk>
And many messages appeared on immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman yelled at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately <unk>
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable by asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times ran a <unk> article for St. <unk> that included readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first urge to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not every request that we were both doing a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and he refused to requests for photos of us two.
I think it was afraid to become a fear of becoming the <unk> of the process of <unk> a range of which I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if they really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce love <unk> not just an adventure, but a real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months old, and I felt, most of all, that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if you were going to go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was, no, I would do the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for interpersonal focus between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> personal <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic isn't it?
But the study did work.
The participants were very close to how to do that, Several later studies, they were also using protocol <unk> protocol, as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it among members of the police and the community. And they've used it among people of political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I took last summer, and it combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, it was cited in this paper, but unfortunately it never got published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a small liberal arts college, and then a student came to me and told me with <unk> I tried the study, and it didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to tell you about the person who would be <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> who did have gotten better to get better after <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really hard shot.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was supposed to almost all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I was focusing on science.
And so I did all I could find about romantic love, and I was hoping that that could kind of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I just thought I was just looking for the book that I wrote but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly -- and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than the reasonably than reasonably to demand me.
What I'm looking for from love is an assurance -- not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to keep up indefinitely for the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people were wondering when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told you about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut for <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the <unk> risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love to make us feel beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it's about love, we are very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that says, still together?
And your content with a response or <unk>
So more than a question, <unk> that let's do more difficult questions, questions like, "How do you decide who your love deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut out and get it?
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads a relationship? Or even more, how do you live in the doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more sophisticated conversation about what to love somebody.
So if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, and we applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still following together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> Love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we took choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I hadn't considered everything that choice was supposed to be.
I didn't think how many times we would have to make that decision, and how much of it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded to 36 questions, and I have chosen to love someone as generous, kind and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what I'm going to do, and what I'm going to spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the very happy end of implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose somebody, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some <unk> in full mountain and in a way I got a <unk> of the forest.
<unk> New York City is a time --  -- something that actually affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and you would put a dollar, a dollar, and a feather and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some <unk> or some of the aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our kind of, <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment, I was in <unk> <unk> like to go and <unk> and <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, I covered them from resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, the opposite: in a way that it seemed to grow up of size -- as if it was that you can get the text with a <unk>
So I was I built more boxes.
And this time, I started to add some electronic elements, frogs, strange bottles that I was finding on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing the same thing that you do about a body in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, <unk> that you can do an idea.
Then I made some insects and strange creatures.
It was a lot of fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of humans inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing in the glass, similar to the drawing in a window, and then in another window, and it had all these windows together, and he had all these windows together that form three-dimensional composition together.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, which I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a big measure in "The garden.
<unk>
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs <unk> pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go out of the world of representation, to this <unk> mesh <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with the heads of animals are headed to <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god <unk> tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform.
All of it also kind of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits oil in a hand while in the other hand as the other hand comes out and clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit a story.
That's the hand that I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, you have a bird <unk> and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> line of a long line of <unk> that joins the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turned fire to the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go up, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eye of 1986.
They have <unk> them.
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards from the terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six year-old project to do 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material whether dictionaries.
But each acts as a kind of file in a human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, divide up.
And you can walk between them. It's getting years old.
Each one is basically a <unk> of microscope that weighs 1,300 pounds.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> she's the chest, you can <unk> the <unk>
I'm going to go through the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and he covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it has -- a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick practice of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body.
This is two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and come into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just like the boxes that we live.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> It's called <unk> <unk>
And within this box, there's a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a writer, an radio, a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world; and a garden.
It <unk> the box and all the people in it hit each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that it's living in.
And together, we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first of the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
So I'm going to take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system for any drug that can be <unk> in the body.
The <unk> though, is that by <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> they serve the number of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart of cells.
But they are also known for their side effects to focus on their most negative, because in time they take it to the current stream -- they are <unk> and worse even over the time it takes to get to their destiny, which is where it's more important: in the HIV store.
These are regions of the body like the lymph nodes -- the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new bacterial cells.
This is the big problem with HIV treatment with the current drugs that are a treatment for life run by <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> to care of wounds and surgery surgery -- can be used for anything else -- including the <unk> transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, that open up and close it up and close to immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people say, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit of a big beam of laser on the cell cell between HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before you even noticed, the hole is <unk>
We're testing this technology in vitro plates or on plates <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> in the site.
The second head, which is a camera, it's going to be the site.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yes. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher in <unk> in our case, a laser <unk>
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups, not <unk> military organizations like terrorists, or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not shoot at them.
My goal is to understand better to these independent agents of violence and study ways of encouraging violent participation to violent <unk>
I do a field work, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups are key to solving almost entirely conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be an <unk> between states.
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between the states and non-state actors.
For example, from the <unk> agreements to <unk> peace between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had had a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
So we know very well the reasons why they do it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and political struggle are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent violent against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
In the same way, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups are doing more than just shooting.
They are multitasking
It would give you a complex machinery of communication stations and radio stations.
And here you have the printed book magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups also invest in a complex fundraising fundraising activity, but by using <unk> business companies for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something more more more -- they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, put in professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
<unk> groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not safe and safety and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan were fighting for war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can be understood by the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price worth of high for the population.
But in general, provide social services means filling a <unk> a <unk> gap by government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, victory electoral victory 2006 cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups we only think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill down gaps by the government, and it comes out as armed and political groups involved in the violent fight and give governance.
And the more complex and more sophisticated ones, these are these organizations, we can least <unk> as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
They were part of a territory, running all their <unk> they collect the trash, run the system of <unk>
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, from nations without state and hybrids and the more weak the states, as in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in wireless tools.
It would make that government void has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand better groups -- we will understand better what incentives to provide the transition from violence to violence.
In this new <unk> between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some <unk> but we won't give peace and stability.
To get these goals together, we need long-term investments to fill in that security test, to fill in that production of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a start.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the tag of <unk> it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm feminist, but rather bad.
And therefore I was struck by a bad feminist.
Or, at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and 20 years old, he had strange ideas about the <unk> these women were <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
It's going to be labeled as a feminist was a taboo and unpleasant word.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who asks too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
And over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, -- <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same paycheck for the same job.
We have the right to travel around the world as either free or violence or violence.
We have right to use the right to use easy and accessible the contraceptives and the services of <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without need for <unk> controls or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to find our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> and <unk> and skills.
We need to have these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this type of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of <unk>
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I went to work, I hear rap music at all volume.
Even though the letter degrades the women and I'm a <unk> the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin <unk> <unk> is amazing.
Do you really have your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely upset by my musical word.
I believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  all the <unk> <unk> but also killing insects, the <unk> and the maintenance collection and maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
<unk> is my favorite color.
<unk> from the fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> fairy fairy fairy <unk>
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise your children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So we had this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> for white, white, <unk> <unk>
<unk> if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist instead.
It also happens, as a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that it's going to give it to perfection.
When we were able to take them up, we take a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself from that <unk> before you try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> fear of what that tag means for fear to not be able to be able to be able to fulfill the expectations very much.
Let's take an example to <unk> or as I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist feminist thing.
In the Video: Music of 2014, in <unk> in front of the word <unk> three feet tall.
It was a <unk> show to see this <unk> star will embrace feminism openly and to know women and young men who are going to be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started endless arguments, if it was not just a feminist.
<unk> their feminism, instead of just believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection from <unk> because we're still fighting for much, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to go much beyond a healthy <unk> and <unk> to <unk> feminism for any woman, <unk> until nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, an <unk> <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We moved from our <unk> to give it to the action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I hear music <unk> I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists are not going to change their way to talk about women in their songs until <unk> change affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does her music be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify the worst choice.
But when bad decisions do this makes it more difficult for women to make equality, the equality that we all deserve to do is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
These are two girls who are <unk> <unk> and bright and very brave.
They are going to tell you for strong creatures that are.
I think of them, all of a sudden the best choice is <unk> as something easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio board when we hear songs that treat women as nothing.
We can spend our money to go to film in another part when movies are not treating women more than as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting sports sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk>
In any case, men, the men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in their magazine, participate in their project, or working with you, until there is not a number of enough of women, so much to be able to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your desktop or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also engage them to be including even more like us to be able to overcome the barriers to the decision making.
Because we are not <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top of the people in the power and producers of cinema and music, <unk> <unk> the people who can make great decisions, to create a meaningful and significant change.
We can also tell the courage to your feminism, well, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist is not to be on <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, mostly because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A little bit of <unk> <unk> when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated as if it was nothing.
I started believing it wasn't nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after I was all not invited to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women that showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what we can measure.
Through the script and of feminism, I also found that if I was a bit brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and realized that none of us is the world that the world is about telling us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope that we all can do the same thing.
I hope that all of us could be a bit courageous, when you need to be <unk>
Just after Christmas of last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> because she was going to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with a <unk> immune system is one of the most easily preventable diseases.
There is an effective vaccine against this century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be really <unk>
But a moment, was not the article that unleashed on autism and vaccines were <unk> and marked by being a fraud <unk> by the British Medical Medical Center.
It doesn't believe the most smart scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines can put their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> who had heard of her to develop all of his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence continued stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
From fundraising as <unk> <unk> refer to as routinely as autism as an epidemic -- as if I could get another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
So if you ask the people at the Center for Disease Control Center to be happening, they tend to based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic and "A best detection of <unk> to explain these numbers <unk>
But that kind of language don't <unk> the fears of a young mother looking at the face of his son of the two years, the eye contact.
If the criteria of diagnosis, they had to be <unk> why they were so <unk> in the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism as hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> from science that we need to be heard of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a kindergarten with a kindergarten -- read from Johns Hopkins Hospital.
They could have fun for hours by waving their hands on their faces, but they could be laughed from panic by <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy into their usual place without knowing it.
Over the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
For the 1950s, as a major authority of the world on the subject, declared that I'd seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome, while <unk> references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving up that diagnosis of children with seizures -- but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
And once he realized that he had become nine of every 10 children sent by other doctors to be a autistic person without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of childhood incidence caused by romantic parents and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have been careful in a refrigerator that you don't know.
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of the young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned out two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills saying things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, the researchers began to test the theory theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive cognitive psychologist, thought that the theory of mothers -- <unk> <unk> was quite <unk>
She and her husband John were warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl who had no support services without special education, no special education and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service, we needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have been done 30 years before.
We had a study of prevalence in autism in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse and diverse as well.
Some kids couldn't talk at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination in the dinosaurs or in the <unk> of the <unk>
In another way, these children didn't get <unk> and <unk> as he said <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How no one had no <unk> of these kids before?
But then I was able to find a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even one translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was German, and he was doing it for her.
The document offers a scientific story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for children with learning differences were <unk> even for <unk> standards.
The morning in his clinic started with exercises with music, and the kids kept their games in Sunday, the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents causing autism, Asperger's described as a disabled disability, of life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces over the course of life.
Instead of treating the children in their clinic as patients, have he called them their little teachers, and he got to help the development of methods of education that were especially right for them.
<unk> has seen autism as a diverse diverse who included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they have always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> <unk> as the awkward social scientist, awkward and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong that autism was <unk> so the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broader and Asperger's model.
These changes not fell into broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people all over the world, see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out -- <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance performance is <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of everyone knew what autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first clinical trials to be used to diagnose autism.
I must no longer have a connection to that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a web effect, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> just like predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact expected that so out, making people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that were <unk>
Then Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the <unk> and a simple, powerful history -- as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention of one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have been joined on the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are for solving for new <unk> doctors, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's cut.
According to <unk> <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a serious attention to the details.
<unk> people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates the <unk> for the most important aspects of autism are found in understanding the teachers, employers with capacity, and the parents to faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on deck for <unk> the boat of <unk>
As we went to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain or a brain.
Thank you.
