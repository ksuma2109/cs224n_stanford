You know what I'm doing doing is to do is write to do is write for the kids, and, in fact, it's probably be the <unk> author -- over the U.S.
And I'm always going to tell the people that I don't want to seem like seem to seem like seem to seem like seem to seem like seem to seem that look like seem to seem like seem to seem like seem to seem that look like seem to seem like seem to seem like seem to seem like seem to seem like seem to seem like seem to seem
I can <unk> it as a farmer, a farmer, the clothing clothing clothing clothes, and never one has ever chosen a farmer.
I'm here here to talk to you today is you to talk about these circles and <unk>
And you know a <unk> one is usually something something that got you somewhere in.
You just have to go back to the apple way to the apple order to see it as a <unk>
That's this is the picture of a circle.
A friend of mine that -- -- Richard <unk>
It's the complicated kind of a complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My whole circle started in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Ohio where I was just like <unk>
When he was beaten up to bleed by bleed in the bathroom bathroom, until a teacher would a teacher saved me.
She saved my life life when you going to go into the bathroom home.
He was doing it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
It was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and ended up in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- -- and -- found a <unk> need to start working on need to start working in organizations that fight against AIDS.
About about three or four years ago, in the middle of the night, I got a phone phone phone <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> see you.
I'm sure that of adults were never got to know us.
You could <unk> <unk> to Ohio Ohio, bring that man I know you've already seen.
And I have to tell you that I have have to tell you that I have have to tell you that I have have to tell you that I have have to tell you that I have have to tell you that I have have to tell you that I have have to tell you that I have have to tell you that I have have to tell you that
All right, the next day we were in <unk> <unk>
We were just going to look at us, <unk> <unk> up, you <unk> and figure out, that she needed to need to be <unk> for.
We had to find a place one, the <unk> and take care for us from his family, because it was it necessary, because it was necessary, for it.
It's something that we knew how to do.
And as the woman who was like, <unk> <unk> as an adult <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> became a <unk> box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was happening was that the circle had happened was that was the one that was the happened was that the circle happened was that the circle happened was that the circle happened was that the circle happened was that the circle happened was that the circle happened was that the circle had happened was that the one is that was the one that
<unk> is that death is part of part of life.
She saved my life, my life, my life, and save it for her.
And you know that part of life is that part of life needs everything that the rest is all about.
It needs truth to be true and beauty, and I'm very happy that you talked about today is a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and love and forth our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to how to express that that humans are not separated separated from nature -- in nature that it's all interconnected.
I was first for the first time to Antarctica age Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was a <unk> <unk>
My heart is quickly, -- <unk> and try to understand what was I in front of me.
The <unk> all around me about the water <unk> almost 60 feet. I was not able to think that it was a <unk> one <unk> about another <unk> snow <unk>
The <unk> are born out of the glaciers in the glaciers or break down down the ice shelves, out.
Every <unk> has its own individual personality themselves.
They have a different way of different way to interact with with their environment environment and their experiences.
Some of them is refuse to give and hold up all the way up to the end, while others can't <unk> <unk> more and get it into a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you can see is looking at a <unk> that they are isolated separated from and alone as we as humans.
But reality is the all the opposite.
As you melts a <unk> <unk> I'm breathing in the <unk> <unk>
As an iceberg is an an iceberg an iceberg like an iceberg like an an iceberg an iceberg like an iceberg an iceberg like an iceberg like an an iceberg an iceberg like an iceberg an iceberg like an iceberg like an an iceberg an iceberg like an iceberg an iceberg like an iceberg like an an iceberg an iceberg like an iceberg an iceberg like an iceberg like an
And I come up to photograph these <unk> <unk> as if we had the portraits of my ancestors, <unk> -- knowing that in these only times are there only that way that way, and will not be just going to have only be just going to have only have it again. again.
It's not death when death is <unk> -- is not an end, not end, see, it's one one of its way for the life cycle of life.
Part of the <unk> ice in the <unk> <unk> I was photograph is very <unk> a <unk> couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice is over 100 thousand years now.
The last pictures that I'd like to show you is to you are from an iceberg one iceberg that I photographed on <unk>
It's unlikely to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to look at an <unk>
Here we go.
You can see the left one to the left left, a small <unk>
It's about five feet meters.
And I'd like you to get you to pay attention to the form of the iceberg and <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can see, you can see here, <unk> <unk> <unk> the boat has moved up to the other side and the man is standing out there.
This is an iceberg an iceberg an iceberg <unk> <unk>

This video is real real time.
And <unk> <unk> shows a different side side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine you to imagine that you can imagine to imagine about two other couples in 1979, the same time, right now, each one is a little <unk> <unk>
So, two are two people every one with a baby.
I don't just want you to get it too much in the details of the conception, you perceive conception, conception, you think about how do you think about conception of you, in this way, -- don't you pay attention to you.
Let's think about think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine you to imagine you in one case, the chromosome and is the sperm and sperm is to the <unk> <unk>
And in the other case, the X sperm of the sperm comes to the sperm the X X X <unk>
And both of them <unk> and start life. out.
We'll get back back to talk about them later.
In my ground activity in the ground -- in my land, <unk> <unk>
In one one of my business roles working in the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I found in in this case is the way that people are looking at the anatomy -- -- -- of human bodies -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- of human bodies are the body <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The other role as performance in my work work is an an activist, a <unk> patients -- or, as I say sometimes, we were <unk> <unk> <unk>
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features of physical features are challenging social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> twins <unk> <unk> two people within a same body.
I've worked with people with people with people very much more low lower than the average average.
And I've been working with many many many cases of people with individual <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are physical typology -- don't fit in normal <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the general lines we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes many many many ways.
I'm going to put to a few examples of examples of ways of a way of you having a have to have a matter of <unk> <unk> out in the common common forms -- or female <unk> <unk>
For example, there's the case of the individual <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then in the life that the testicles <unk> <unk> make testosterone.
But because this does is that this individual does is that that this individual does is that is that of the receivers of testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the syndrome <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So, there are high high levels of high testosterone levels without reaction.
As a result, the body develops following the following one course a particular course <unk> <unk>
When I <unk> the baby <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a little boy, it's raised as a little girl.
And often, it's not it be it until puberty, we be growing up and developing the <unk> but don't you have the menstrual <unk> when someone realizes is going to be happening.
And then they got to make a test tests you realize that instead of have <unk> <unk> and <unk> it really has <unk> <unk> <unk>
The important thing to understand is that that is a man to think this is a man, a man, but it's not really not like this.
<unk> like men, we have in the body something called called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
The <unk> <unk> produce <unk> <unk> the <unk>
Most of the most women like me -- -- -- -- -- I consider myself consider its <unk> <unk> <unk> I think, is to be a typical woman most most women are being sensitive being <unk> sensitive about.
We are producing <unk> we <unk> <unk> and respond to <unk>
As a result, someone has got to have the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> <unk> <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing, it is not that the <unk> are <unk> -- are in the middle of you in a certain way they can all everywhere.
Another example: years ago, I got a call from a <unk> 19 years old, born and raised as <unk> she had <unk> <unk> and raised as <unk> she had <unk> <unk> <unk> and had her life as like a guy and had to find it that he was happy? <unk> again.
It was a very extreme way of a disease of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had 20th <unk> the 20th 20th <unk> on the uterus <unk> <unk> glands were so active -- in essentially creating a kind of a male <unk> environment.
As a result, its genitals <unk> <unk> his brain was going to the into the hormone component, hormone hormone hormone hormonal component hormone a male male.
He was born with a <unk> <unk> no one -- nothing.
And it was the age 19 when they started to have problems were caused by the <unk> internal <unk> <unk> when doctors found that, in fact, was a woman on the way in.
Well, another quick example of one is <unk> <unk>
Some of some people with international chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We don't know about what is going about what is going to happen.
So, there are many many many many different varieties of sex. of sex.
The reason that children are kids with with this kind of bodies, the bodies are kids about with this kind of body <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason we got to get together to various surgeries you are a threat for our social categories.
The system is kind about in the idea that one particular anatomy brings <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have to have the idea that it is to be a woman to be woman is going to be a woman to have to have an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you mean to have African anatomy <unk>
Very simplistic <unk> <unk>
And when you have a body one body that shows something pretty different, we got problems with <unk>
So so we have a whole lot of very divergent ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of very much very romantic concept of very much very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that is to have children being born in a single body.
The latest recent case is the last year with last year of the past year with last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Many journalists were called to wonder: how to ask myself, what do you have to do is what do we have to be able to be doing is going to do to determine whether to <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that we don't have such a test.
In fact, we now know that is the sex that we have to admit is that that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line <unk> between men and women and <unk> and <unk> are us who who we can draw that online line. out.
So what we have to have is a situation where we have to have is really admit that these categories -- -- -- were thought of were thought of were thought of were thought about were thought about were thought about were thought about were thought about were thought about were thought about were thought about were thought about were thought about were thought about were thought about were thought
And not just be only in the terms of the sex.
Also in terms of the race of race, something that is much more complicated than the future would the future <unk> is.
As we see, we put up into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> For example, the fact that we share with at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do we about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of them in just a few few <unk> <unk>
And as we were going to go on in science we have to recognize the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are probably just too <unk> too about.
And we're looking at this is all all of the <unk> <unk>
One of you of them, for example, in our current current culture in the United States today, are the fighting <unk> <unk>
It's hard to set a moment from a time that a body is a body is a human and got different rights to the <unk>
There's is there are there are there are there are there are there are there are there are there are there are there are there are there are there are there are there that are very <unk> <unk> discussions <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> not public -- not public -- but do about when someone is considered died.
Our ancestors never had to have to do with them with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot very long got a pen down a pen pen into the nose and then I moved still not <unk>
If you just stopped moving off to the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, we have to get vital organs life vital organs from a body, and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma very much really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really
And maybe you think that this is such a categories of categories <unk> could be happy like me.
In politics I'm a <unk> liberal, a <unk> people with the things with unusual bodies, these things are unusual -- but have to admit it to me that you have a nervous one.
I mean, these categories are much much more fragile than we thought about <unk>
We were going to get it from the point of the point of the concept of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this is first that you tell you about this is first that you have to tell you about this is first one is tell you about this is first that you have to tell you about this is first of you first have to tell you about this is first that I can admit that I'm just admit that I'm a fervent one is a
I know they were a <unk> <unk> I know that they were <unk> -- but but they were really large.
I mean, they were to be so brave and bold and audacious audacious <unk> <unk> radical <unk> in what they did, that I find myself so much to seeing that musical <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is what happened to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> were <unk> -- for me, the first activists in the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was <unk> -- was a <unk> <unk> concept and <unk> <unk> it with another that was radical and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful and beautiful
And as all as we all remember what, -- our <unk> <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was just about a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The <unk> of the old world didn't know about the DNA, but had the point of the idea of it right for birth.
They had the concept of the concept of blue <unk>
They were from the idea that it was coming out of the idea that it was going to be able to political power by the right-hand case of blood was passed from the grandfather into the father and later on, and forth.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it for a new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of that concept was that all all men are created the same.
They were going to look at the game field game field game field, and decided that the anatomy that was really mattered about was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a kind of a <unk> system that they were actually <unk> two and two things.
It was a <unk> democracy about democracy <unk> and at the same time we were going to have science.
And there is it very clear if we look at the story of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that many were really interested in science and interested in science and interested in science and <unk> idea.
They were <unk> <unk> from the current explanations explanations <unk> <unk> <unk> the concept of <unk> power was <unk> <unk> <unk> was going to a very vague idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> <unk> concept.
And if you look at for example, you for example, -- look at you for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example, for example,
They don't talk about God and all the nature of God.
They are talking about power of nature power -- to tell us who we are.
And consequently, we were going to go off the idea of the <unk> <unk>
And as you do so, they were actually laid the foundations of the future <unk> <unk>
They didn't think about it, it that for us and it was great.
And what happened later next?
And women were <unk> <unk> <unk>
Then they came to the design of the Civil Rights of the Civil Rights of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines in the state movement of the Civil Rights of the Civil Rights of the Civil Rights of the Civil Rights of the Civil Rights of the Civil Rights of the Civil Rights of the Civil Rights of the Civil Rights of the Civil Rights of the Civil Rights of the Civil Rights of the Civil Rights of the Civil Rights of the Civil Rights
Again, people of color people going to go into the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We look at the same thing with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, we look at the <unk> we have to start asking questions why we keep to keep certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep a few few little <unk> <unk> on our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights you as to a human.
I don't just mean that we need to do is we use anatomy. for anatomy.
I don't mean to say that is the five five years of five age of five years, they were supposed to have to have sex with sexual relationships or get married.
There's a few little <unk> <unk> that to me that for me that is sense and that I think we should <unk> <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out, what are they about why to keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back back to those two things <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> <unk> both <unk> in <unk> exactly the same time.
Imagine that one of you of them, you Mary, was born three months before time of time: the night June 1 <unk>
Henry, Henry, could the other <unk> was born was was born of the night was born on the night was born on the night was born.
So by the only fact that I was born about was born three months before I was born in was born three months before the age of Mary -- is all attributed all the last three months three months before I was Henry -- -- -- the right to the age of Henry -- -- -- the right to the age of Henry -- -- -- -- the right to
Henry You have to wait for all that is all that is not because it has a little different age different, but because it was born of the after.
We found other <unk> <unk> for their rights.
Henry, I can Henry, in virtue being considered a man to be considered a man -- not told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being a man is considered now <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for which that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary. It's not the same rights of the rights to the marriage that was Henry all in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman to a few few states.
So this is still make much similar categories categories categories <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that we do now that we do now that the case that science went up to the point that we have to admit that a democracy does is to have to have to admit that a democracy is going to have to say that a democracy is going to have to admit that a democracy is going to have to
I don't want to give up in science, but at the same time sometimes I felt like that science is <unk> us.
Where are we <unk> <unk>
It seems to what happen in our culture is sort of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we have to draw the line somewhere, so we are going to do."
But many people are left in a strange position.
For instance, you mean for example, that is Texas at a certain time has decided to to get married with a man not to have to have a chromosome and got to the <unk> and have a woman to have to get married with a woman, you have to have to have a <unk> <unk>
Now, in the practice now do do tests do a test tests for people people.
But this is also really strange for the story that I told the first story of the syndrome that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If we look at one one of the founders of the founding fathers of the most powerful parents the founders of modern democracy, modern democracy, modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It says we should now judge people are going to go down in the color in their skin -- not on color in their skin -- not in the color of their skin, it but on the contents of their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I would say, "Yes, the idea is very much good for you.
But in a practice, what do you do?
How do we judge people judge people based on the contents of their <unk> <unk>
I want to point out also that that we have to point to point that is that I'm not sure that we should have been going to take care about it for <unk> rights to people, rights to people people, because I will admit that I know about some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I also want to say that maybe some of them <unk> that we can make more intelligent <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So how do we put in actually put in the issue of the <unk> <unk> issue of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me what would happen happen if the character of one person could in the future being measured on with an instrument, <unk>
Do we really want to get that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is, it seems to be really important that it seem to be really important to be very important to the United States continue to lead this current current thing to the issue of democracy.
We've made a good job in defense defense system, democracy democracy, and I think we'll make a good job in the future.
We are not live in, for in a context like the Iranian where a man who is attracted to be attracted other men about being killed by the other men is willing to have to have to have a <unk> change of sexual change, in which case you want to live.
We're not in that situation.
So I'm glad to say that we have not to say that we don't have a context of the context of a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago, I had had to give birth to light <unk> <unk> <unk>
But when the phone was one very <unk> <unk> <unk> operation was going to have a very <unk> <unk> operation, I was told in that other country -- these children would be very <unk> and so so so so therefore we have to do that. it.
So I said, "Well, it's considered to be in the political marriage <unk> <unk> <unk>
America offers huge possibilities for people to be able to be able to change it for the very good one the state.
So I think we have to have to have that we have to have to have that we have to have to have your head up.
Well, I'll just finish the end -- I mean that I've been talking about a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what it would be like is what democracy would be like is what democracy would be like is what democracy would be like is what democracy would be like is what democracy would be like is what democracy would be like is what democracy would be like is what democracy would be like is what democracy would be like is what democracy would be
And I mean, something a little bit radical for a <unk> a little bit radical for a <unk> one is that I think there can be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about group in.
Since I have have to have have have been interested interested in the <unk> I've also been interested interested in research to investigate the sexual differences.
And one of the things that I'm interested in me is the differences between men and women to thinking about and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> <unk> <unk> is be that is women -- on average -- -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships attention to complex social relationships to complex social relationships attention to complex social relationships attention to complex social relationships care about the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, I was was at graduate graduate school, one of my advisers <unk> who knew that I was interested in my feminism <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Do you know what is it about <unk> <unk>
And I thought, well, it's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with all get rid with all get rid with all get rid with all get rid with all get rid with all get rid with all get rid with all get rid with all get rid with all get rid with all get rid with all get rid with all get rid with all get rid with all get rid with all get rid with the
But the more I thought about your question, most more there is something that there is something about a female <unk> in <unk>
I mean, there might be there that there might be something that there might be kind about, there might be something about, on on average, average, a matter something different from the brain that is the human brain brain and the brain and the male brain is going to make us more excited about the way to complex social relationships to the most vulnerable.
So while the <unk> were all very easy at them, they were very easy to find the way to protect people in the part of the state, is that that we had more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> concept concept for <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do is we have to do is what we have to do is what we have to do is what we have to do is what we have to do is what we have to do is do in the future when we would make it think less about the individual body body, in your individual body body, in the individual body, in
So while we tried to create a very much more <unk> <unk> let's think about what do we do with each other each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, we decided we had to have to think about what we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family is to think about where do you want to go to live and work, work and work, and have the chance to choose about between the other few different different cities that are competing to attract new people.
Well, right now, we are far away from that point.
There are millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of people in developing countries in developing countries that
But what are the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth a lot more than their cost of cost of cost out.
So we can easily resist the world into the world, <unk> <unk> perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may be absurd as absurd if you have never think about new cities.
But we just got it through by buildings of apartments.
Imagine that the half half of those you wanted to live on apartment apartments that is the one half the other half of the people just not lack to do this.
They could try to increase the <unk> ability to <unk> around in all of the existing buildings.
But you know what the problem is <unk> <unk> <unk> is about is that is that those buildings are all and and got rules out to avoid the same way together, and avoid the <unk>
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk> <unk>
But they could go to a whole new place again -- build a new apartment apartment together, new -- and when the rules of that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So I suggested the governments <unk> to have new reform zones of big reform zones of big reform zones of big reform zones of big reform zones of big reform zones of big reform zones of big reform zones of big reform zones of big reform zones of big reform zones of big reform zones of big reform zones of big reform zones of big reform zones of big reform
Later I learned out that sort of just at the same time, <unk> <unk> and were thinking about the challenge of challenge they to reform it.
Did you know what could they do to do to do to make that do to do to do to make that do to do to do to make that do to do to do to make that do to do to do to make that do to do to do to make that do to do to do to make that do to do to do to make that
In the summer of the summer of the middle of the summer of the middle of the summer of the middle of the middle of the summer of the middle of the middle of the summer of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of
In the next regular <unk> regular <unk> regular <unk> regular <unk> regular <unk> national <unk> regular <unk> regular <unk> national elections, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a platform in which we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
He asked <unk> out his head of <unk> <unk>
Meanwhile, I was going to get a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> <unk> <unk> trial and <unk> and error -- and a lot of a whole lot of great amount of tests with users, users, we tried to reduce this complicated concept of city concept of cities that are <unk> <unk>
The first point was the important importance of standards, like these rules that you can't can go and annoy at all the current residents of apartments.
It will very much lot very much good attention to new technologies, new technologies, you need to <unk> -- and are usually the rules that you are going forward.
In the fall of the fall of the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala was <unk> <unk> <unk> a bond with the TEDTalk.
I showed it to <unk>
They were called me to me.
They said, <unk> this is the leaders of our <unk>
So in December of you in December we met in Miami, a conference room room.
I tried to explain this point point about how valuable people are cities, much more valuable than their cost costs.
And I used this picture shows the one of the land value in the ground one place like New <unk> <unk> <unk> land that in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a fairly abstract argument and kind of and at some moment, when there was a <unk> pause, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe we see the video from the talk <unk>
And the talk was described in very simple simple terms of simple simple terms of simple simple terms, that a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> the rules that are <unk> over there and a <unk> option for people to choose whether to go to do if they want to do if they want to do if they want to go or live
So the president of <unk> <unk> I called me called me -- and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way the way the way our country is forward.
He asked me to be a <unk> and talk about again the four and five <unk>
So I presented a whole talk full of data full of data, data, this is sort of like to explain that is that we have to make a lot very big value to a city, this is very much going to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
This is just this <unk> airport, over more than 100 square square thousand square miles.
So I was just trying to convince the <unk> <unk> that we can build a new city, new city, you have to start with a place that <unk> <unk> <unk> at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 <unk> <unk>
The whole whole world <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk> out.
The team of Congress was approached on the platform, and he said, <unk> -- thank you very much much for your talk, talk, but maybe we be able to see the video from the talk video game.
I got here in my <unk> <unk>
So I sat down and show the TEDTalk.
And this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you might could be in <unk> <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the way up to the North.
And they also also encourage new <unk> choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government <unk> <unk> would need help from countries countries were <unk> could benefit from the countries that they were going to be able to establish and make the rules for the <unk> so that they can all all be <unk> out.
We went and saw a place.
This is picture out there.
It could be easily <unk> a full <unk> <unk>
And shortly later on 19 <unk> voted in the Congress to <unk> <unk> his Constitution -- and to add a constitutional willingness for a constitutional arrangement of allow us to create these special special product.
In a country that I had just passed through this was crisis we was going through through this crisis we was going to go through this <unk> crisis the <unk> <unk> constitutional <unk> was <unk> <unk>
All the parties -- -- all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass two times in Congress.
On the <unk> <unk> was passed over again on a other way we were going to <unk> for one.
Immediately after the voting is voting with is voting with, from 21 to the age of the 21 to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about 30 <unk> <unk> went to the two places in the world that are most interested in part part about building cities.
One of them is the South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big <unk> center in the city that is really building up in <unk> <unk> <unk> is bigger than the heart is center.
Everything you can see there is this was built up there was this was built up there was that was built up in this is built in four years old, after that that was four years of <unk> <unk>
The other country is interested in building cities that cities is cities that we are cities in cities is the other place.
In fact, they already built two cities in China in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this very practical way, this way, is practical way, way, way, practical way, is practical way, practical way, practical way, practical way, practical way, practical way, practical way, practical way, practical way, practical way, practical way, this is practical way. <unk>
They have a place place, and are already thinking about a place for the second one for the second city.
They're making a legal legal system that would allow managers <unk> <unk> and be able to be under an entire external legal system.
A country has has been committed is committed to allow her for the last instance for this new system <unk>
There are the urban <unk> the dominant cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get a little bit about funding.
But the only thing we know that you have have have been solved for, you have have solved -- have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many many companies that you wanted to move in, move into the <unk> especially in a place with a free free <unk> zone, free <unk> -- there are many people to what would you like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 people in the world that they would just like to change it to the other place.
There's a million million dollars a year out of America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who they had to leave them back to their family to go get a job for work, work, and sometimes you have to have the money for just eat or buy their clothes.
Sadly, I even even have kids to meet people meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what are you like to think about building a new city in <unk> <unk>
Or do you build a half a dozen of these these all all over the world world.
What do you like to do is thinking to do we think to do with insist in insist in a number of cities that are being competing for attract new <unk>
This is one idea worth worth spreading.
And my <unk> friends <unk> was asked me to say, "Thank you for TED Labs.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk> <unk>
But before I show you before you show you what is inside the inside, I'm going to do a public confession -- and that is that I live obsessed obsessed about?
I love to find up, dress, and later photograph and post on my blog <unk> <unk> colorful and different and colorful <unk>
But I did not buy anything new.
All my whole whole whole number is second second hand of <unk> markets <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores, I would allow me to reduce the impact on my <unk> <unk> in the environment and my <unk> <unk>
I go up to meet people -- are people <unk> by the general my money is going to a good <unk> -- my look like is <unk> <unk> and buy it in my search personal <unk>
I mean, what do I'm going to find out today?
It's going to be from my <unk>
I'm going to like color for?"
It will cost you less than 20 dollars?
If you all know if all the answer are positive, positive, <unk> I feel like I won.
So going to go back to the point of my <unk> <unk> I want to tell you what was going to come in for this very exciting week last week.
I mean, what do you bring with somebody that is all that whole <unk>
So I'm just going to show exactly exactly what I was in?
I brought out to seven all the clothes inside up all the way up.
It's inside for exactly one week is all I put in my <unk>
I thought it would be be able to find everything what else I wanted to use to use after you get here to <unk> <unk>
And since you don't know about how the woman who is walking around TED for TED -- in all the way, -- -- that means I found a few few things.
And I would like to show you now the sets up for this week.
Doesn't it sound that interesting? interesting?
While I'm also going to tell you some some of some of the lessons of life life -- -- -- or not, I have learned in this case of not use new clothes in new time.
Let's start on with Sunday.
This is what I called you <unk> <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot very much good money to look at.
You can almost always see is phenomenal you very <unk> for less than 50 dollars.
All of the <unk> including <unk> <unk> me <unk> and is the most expensive I used in week.
<unk> the color is as energy as energy in.
It's just about impossible to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot long time in life in life trying to be myself same and same <unk>
I just know yourself.
If you get to get away from the right people, you not just tell you, from the right people -- are you going to get you <unk> too.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you take inside.
Sometimes people have people tell me that it look like play to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I like to <unk> it <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
If you think you see that you see is you see a good thing about something, it is pretty much that you are.
And if you think you're not good at you with something, something -- probably it be true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until even the age 30 years, I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside -- there is you not look at any look at you that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse no one of this audience. audience.
We must be able to achieve everything that we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And finally, we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a personal <unk> <unk> way to the world something about you without having to say a word.
I tried this one and again when people were approached my week -- just why I was using, and got fantastic conversations.
And obviously this is all this is all that go to go into my little <unk>
So before I go home to go home to Brooklyn, the time, I was going to give it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to go back up with certain things.
I don't even need <unk> <unk> I am emotionally emotionally engaged in, because back around the corner, the corner, you always have a crazy crazy little <unk> <unk> colorful and colorful and colorful <unk> if there is a little bit of love in my heart in my heart.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a depiction of your brain that can actually divide them in two parts together.
The next side side side side, it's the kind of the logical part <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So if we put up a scale scale to measure the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we could design a plan in our brain.
For example, this one would be just be someone that is completely logical.
So this would be just be a kind of one that is completely absolutely intuitive.
So where do we tell you <unk> your brain at this scale?
Some of them <unk> one of these extreme extremes, but many of the people in this audience in this audience, you audience, audience, your brain is -- -- with a big <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can can make it be logical and be intuitive.
I consider myself one one of those people, that as most majority of other other quantum quantum <unk> we really need to need some pretty logic to <unk> <unk> these complicated ideas <unk>
But at the same time, we really need to do we really do we really do we really do we really do we really do we really do we really do we really do we really do we really do we really do we really do we really do we really do we really do we really do we really do we really do we really do we really much
How do we develop this <unk> <unk> Well, we really like to play with this.
We are just going to play with them with them them, and then we see how we are <unk> -- and then we develop our intuition in our intuition out of that point.
And actually, you actually do the same thing.
<unk> intuition can be developed in the years that is that one thing can one thing is that one thing can one is only be only in one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound sound weird is going to really sound weird enough to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, same time, but -- but just not born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking parking parking parking place.
It was a little little boy and didn't really well do it very well, they are always going very much.
But I bet you play with that bar play with that spider bar I was going to play a lot very valuable idea, and that is that the big things don't allow them to get them to them and get it to them and get it to the <unk>
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you are a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist in particles, a particle physicist -- don't play with car bars from parking car bars play with these strange <unk>
And when they play with their particles discover that they do all things really weird -- -- as you can go through walls, walls, or can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all all and all all that are all of these observations, -- and the so-called theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics a few years ago: traits, this is be a few years of a few years of a few years of a few years older years ago: you needed to quantum mechanics to describe these little little particles.
But don't you need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That isn't really good at me very good at my intuition, and maybe it's not very often that often be very often often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play a game with them, but very much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, never anyone saw a <unk> <unk>
But don't it really be good at me good at my whole <unk>
Because if everything is all made of little little particles and little little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics here, quantum mechanics, then -- not all be all going to follow all going to follow the way to the principles of <unk>
I don't find the reason why they shouldn't should.
And so I would really feel a lot better if I could somehow somehow demonstrate that a common object is also about beginning of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did that.
This is the first object that you can see is that it's been in a sample of quantum mechanics.
So what do we see here is a little computer chip little computer here.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of little bit of the metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object. <unk>
And here's what I'm going to get it a little bit bit. It's right at the <unk>
And then here we do is a very well approach very well be a big good thing to the small <unk> little <unk> <unk>
What we can see here is a little bit little bit bit of little little bit of metal metal, a springboard springboard and foot supportive on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would just to do a computer chip.
I went to a <unk> clean room with a new silicon silicon silicon new, and put it going to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to have to build my own machine own little hole <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This device is that it has the ability to be on in a particular theory, quantum <unk> play -- but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how good it is to be in an elevator <unk>
I mean, when I'm on in an elevator alone, I do all all do all a whole kind of weird things but -- but when other people go up to do those things, because I don't want to do it it will be it? on?
Quantum mechanics says that the inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> of the inanimate objects are also just the light that the light <unk> <unk> -- and the wind that happens next to the side and the wind heat off. out.
So we knew that, if we wanted to know that, if this piece of metal is to be <unk> according to the quantum mechanics, quantum mechanics, have you to <unk> <unk>
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then we introduced we introduced a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and put it at it to a temperature at less than a degree for absolute zero.
Now, I was just going to be only in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free to act as possible.
So we measured their movement movements. out.
We found out there was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the way they were <unk> -- was a kind of a kind of a breath in a way -- -- like a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when you to give a soft thrust, we could do that we have to do it -- at the same time -- -- something that is only about with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really is something something really fantastic.
What does this mean is that that is a <unk> thing to <unk> and don't <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still -- and at the same time those same atoms are moving moving up up up and down.
It's only in certain <unk> <unk> when those are <unk> <unk>
In the rest of the rest of time are <unk> <unk>
It means to say that each other atom is atom is two different places at the same time, same time means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is really cool.
True thing.
<unk> a little piece of difference between that little piece of difference between that little little bit difference between that little little bit bit about between that little little bit bit about between that little piece of difference between that little little bit bit about.
So if one one is only one atom can can be only in two different places at the same time, same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, this is my kind of logic that logic is talking about.
So imagine if you were in many places at the same time, time, how would that would be that?
How do your consciousness <unk> if your body was <unk> <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And that's when we <unk> it and back the lights and looked into the box, we saw that the metal was still in one piece of piece.
And I could get to get this new intuition, apparently all all the objects in the elevator is really only quantum things that are quantum objects <unk> in a small space.
You hear about a lot about a lot bit about about that quantum mechanics say it's all interconnected.
Well, that's not just so much true.
It's more than that, it is more profound.
It's that those of these connections, our connections to all all the things that you, you literally define you who you are, you who you are, and that's that is the deep <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
My name is <unk> <unk>
And it was 18 with another <unk> work on Google Google, until I launched the idea to do something that is to do something that is to do something that is to do something that is to do something that is to do something that is to do something that is to do something that is to do something that is to do something that is to do something that
It took me 18 18 months and 18 and 18 and 18 and 18 and 18 and 18 and 18 and 18 and 18 and 18 to it.
Many and stories and stories, <unk> <unk> it with 17 very interesting <unk> very interesting <unk>
But I'm going to focus on <unk> <unk>
There's a lot lot of stories of the stories of the why we did.
I think my own story is going to come up in this slide and just this is just the have access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- -- not <unk> <unk> but don't have access to many many of these people and many many of these people to many of these things and many of many of these them and many many many of these people to many of these things and many many of these people to many of these art and many of these art and <unk>
So when I first started traveling out traveling to travel to travel home, museums, and started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the wish that is more accessible to technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and started to do it.
Better a demo to then you explain a couple of interesting things that we have been taken on from their launch.
So, let's just warn you, we're going to go to the <unk>
Look around all all the entire museums out there.
There's the <unk> gallery <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm just going to go into one of my favorite ones in one of my favorite ones, the <unk> <unk>
There are there that there are two very simple thing to do it -- very simple.
We can click and forth -- are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> <unk> or <unk> it doesn't really matter.
You moving around and get it out.
They want to navigate for the <unk>
We open up the top, and with one click click inside. out.
They are inside, you want to go at the end of the hall way.
You go ahead and go ahead with it.
<unk>
Thank you, but haven't a better way.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, favorite paintings, <unk> <unk> Pieter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was looking at the <unk> sign of <unk>
If the museum is the image this picture, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here is all the whole data of <unk> <unk>
For those of you who are really really interested in art in art, you click around, but click on right now.
And this is one one of the images that we've captured by called the <unk> technology.
So this image image, -- -- I think, I think, -- I think, -- I think, -- I think, -- I think, -- I think, -- I believe, -- I think, -- I think, -- I think, -- I think, -- I think, -- I believe, -- I think, -- I think, -- I think, -- I think, -- I think, -- I think, -- I think, -- I think,
And there are many many people to ask me, is, what do you get with 10,000 <unk> <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really show you what you really can actually get with you with 10,000 million pixels.
It can zoom in in around very simple way.
You can see things fun things fun things going to be happening.
I love this guy, its voice <unk> <unk>
But if you really wish to do is we <unk>
So I started to play, play, and find myself with something that was going on there.
And I was like, "A moment, this is <unk> <unk>
I went back up, and discovered that children were actually actually playing with something.
And I did was a little bit recently about talking to some other <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and I actually found out this is a game called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a little <unk>
And apparently it was a very popular.
I don't know, why they did, they did, but have learned something about it.
And now we're now going to get away with even more depth and close up, see that you can actually get even the way to the cracks.
Now I'm just going to give you a little bit about perspective, I'm going to take away the image picture, you can see really what are there that is.
This is where we were, now, and this is a piece of painting.
The best is coming, a second one second.
So now we now are now going to quickly jump over again at the time at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk> <unk>
The example I showed you was to find a few little detail details.
But what happens if you want to look at the <unk>
And if you want to see how they're Van <unk> -- actually created this <unk> <unk>
It goes up and really well <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this <unk> and I'm really going to going to get the to the cracks.
This is "the night <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen that before.
I'm going to show another one another one other favorite functions of my favorite features.
There's a lot of things about stuff over here, but I don't have time to <unk> it.
This is really cool -- this is <unk> <unk>
All of you all of you, -- absolutely everybody, no matter whether it's rich or rich or poor, you have an <unk> <unk>
You can online create their own own own museum a collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walk -- -- I've created this as a function that I call <unk> <unk> of the <unk> -- just <unk> <unk>
It's about "The <unk> <unk>
You can can write about to send her friends and keep a conversation about looking at these <unk> <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, first is that all amazing things really really do have Google Google.
No, in my mind, they even have come from come from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually, actually come from from those artists. artists.
And that's that one has been my humble experience experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium is digital medium digital is it in this digital medium is to make justice to their art work in art and that is automatically being represented properly online.
And the great question I got to do today is me today is you do this to do this is you do this to do this to do this to do this to do this to do this is to repeat the experience to go to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to the <unk> experience.
And that's all -- thank you.
Thank you.
Good <unk> everybody.
I got something to show you.
So think it's a <unk> <unk> a <unk> flying <unk> was.
In our lab we called we called this is incredibly sensitive design.
I'll tell a little bit about this.
If you look at this is picture -- picture -- picture -- picture of all the kids in Italy growing up with this picture on the wall of his room wall wall, your bedroom. But the reason I'm going to show this is that that has happened is something something really interesting about <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now if you one wanted to win a <unk> career, a <unk> career, it took a budget and got it to a good pilot and a good one.
And if the car and car and the pilot is, the car was good enough, -- you really won your career.
This is what in the engineering -- is in the engineering, it will <unk> real control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>
What is interesting about is that the real control systems in real time control systems are real time is going to get into our lives.
Our cities, in the last years, have have been covered with networks and electronic electronics.
They're going to go back up into the spare air.
And as a <unk> are they're starting to respond differently and can answer very differently <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As you can see is just to say that cities are only two percent of the world's cortex of the planet -- but represent the 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the <unk> consumption of <unk> <unk> <unk> us and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with something with the cities, we are cities, would be a big thing.
Beyond the cities, all these are <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is an <unk> <unk> <unk> last year at <unk> <unk>
It's called <unk> <unk> Uncle <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, the environment, start <unk> out.
In a certain way it is like almost all the existing atoms are now going in in place place in place in the existing atoms in the existing atoms are now going in in place place in the existing atoms are now going in in place place in the existing atoms are now going in in place place in the existing atoms are now going in in place place in
And that's the changing changing the interaction that we as humans have with with the outer environment.
In a sense, it's almost like in the old <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You know, when Miguel <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> tell me at the end he took <unk> <unk> and then you can still see a small little <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk> up.
And I'm going to just show you just just about <unk> <unk> <unk> the environment and get a thing.
Let's start to start with the detection
The first project I wanted to share with share with is share with share with you with share with you with share with you with is sharing with share with you with you is really share with you with you is really be just one of the first projects of our lab.
This was about four and a half half ago in Italy.
It was a summer a summer stage a summer <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was the year that I won the <unk>
Maybe some of you remember that, you who was playing Italy -- who were who were playing Italy who were playing Italy who were playing Italy -- who were playing Italy who were playing Italy who were playing Italy who were playing Italy who were playing Italy who were playing Italy who were playing Italy who were playing Italy who were playing Italy who were playing Italy -- who were
And anyway, I was the end of the end -- at the end -- at the end -- at the end -- at the end -- the end -- the end is the end of the end -- in the end -- the end is, at the end at the end -- at the end last time, the end is the end of the end -- in the end --
Now let's look at what country that country is country happened now happened now happened now happened now happen to happen by looking at the activity in the Web.
Here we see the city the city.
It looks at the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is now is on the top.
And then they early there are people here to come here and there doing <unk> <unk>
It begins the <unk> silence.
<unk> <unk> France.
<unk> people do a call fast as fast as you <unk>
Second <unk> End of time. <unk> <unk>
First time is first <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
earns Italy, we know!
That night was all all going to go back at the <unk>
There you see the big summit.
The next day next day we were all all in the center in the first of the Nobel <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Prime Minister then.
And then all the whole world <unk>
You can see the picture is the place that is <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> where, from <unk> <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a big party, you can see the peak at the end of the end of the day.
This is just an example one example of the way that the city can you can now measure this is now be measure the pulse in the city a way that we would not have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> <unk> is not about people, it's about things we used and consume it.
Today, we know about all about the form of our <unk>
This is a map that shows all all the chips that make up a look like how to <unk>
But we know very little about where are things going about.
So in this project, we developed some small <unk> tags to track the garbage trash into the system.
We started with some of us with some of us with some of us with some of us with some of us with some of us with some of us with some of us with some of us with some of us with some of us with some of us with some of us with some of us with some of us with some of us with some of us
Then we had a little little little little bit little bit small chip, a <unk> <unk> <unk> and then we <unk>
These are the results <unk> <unk>
I was just standing of <unk>
After a week.
And with this information information, we realize that there are many many <unk> <unk> <unk> in the system.
We can do the same very much less bit less about with much much less about with much much less much about to do that.
These are data data that before there was before.
They're all happening very complicated things and hard transportation transport.
But the other thing we think is, if we look at every day that the cup that <unk> <unk> <unk> is still somewhere on the planet.
If if the plastic bottle of plastic just <unk> <unk> <unk> day is still still right there.
What if we showed you that to the people, then we can promote any change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> could tell us much much more about detecting detection and many other things really cool we can do with that, -- but want to go to the second part that we talked about at the very beginning, which is just push about the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in ...
It all all began with a question from the mayor of the city, the city came up and told us that that Spain -- -- and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water use in the water use in public space in public space -- in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology can technology can technology, technology, new technology, to come to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT at MIT, in a stage, was, if you have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It creates a bit like a <unk> curtain of water, water <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you fall down the pixels the pixels -- can you can write about patterns, -- images texts.
And in the side, the curtain will open up so that we can see in the picture.
We introduced to we introduce this to the <unk> mayor
He liked this a lot very long thing.
And he <unk> a commission one commission to design the building into the <unk> <unk>
We called it <unk> <unk> <unk>
All the building is all about water.
There is no doors no doors and windows but not but windows -- but when you is going to open up so that you can actually happen.
The ceiling is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind wind, wind, you want to minimize the <unk> <unk>
Or you can close up the building, and all the architecture is lost, like this.
Those days will always be someone, in the winter, when the roof left, the roof is down there, and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they <unk> it is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is here we going to work.
You can look at the people <unk> what is going in.
And here I am just myself trying to not <unk> the test sensors that that you open up the water.
I think I should just tell you what one night happened one night when all the sensors were going to work.
That night was really even more fun.
All the <unk> kids in <unk> came to the building, because the way to interact have changed a little bit.
It was no longer a <unk> building to open to leave it -- but a building a building that was going on going to break it back down and <unk> and jump back down to <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how do we really think about how we think about how do we really think about how we think about how do we really think about how we think about how do we really think about how we think about how do we really think about how we think about how we
But then the reality is always always be unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things things to <unk> <unk> that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the building with the physical pixels the physical pixels right, physical pixels -- physicists are, the pixels of water, you and projections of them.
And that's what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those <unk> could could fly.
Imagine that you could have to have a little little helicopters little helicopters in the air, and each one of you had a little little <unk> that changes color as if there was a cloud that is moving in space.
This is this one video one.
Imagine a helicopter, like what we saw before, is moving with others in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud,
A kind of kind of a flexible screen like this is this with a kind of kind of a kind of flexible screen like this is a kind of a flexible screen for this is in a kind of flexible screen as this sort of flexible screen as this sort of flexible screen as this sort of flexible screen as this sort of flexible screen as this sort of flexible
Or do you know, in three of us in which what is going to change is is all about is the light, not the end of the atomic position.
You can play with a different kind else.
Imagine that the screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different different kinds of different resolution.
And then all that can be a pixels in the pixels in 3D cloud that you can get close to and <unk> and see it from very many different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> going down down down down down down down to form a <unk>
When the light lights up, the light, looks like what we saw before.
Imagine each other one of them being controlled by one person.
We can have to have every pixel with one input that comes from people, of the movement of people, people -- of the people, and etc. and forth.
I want to show it something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> best <unk> <unk> about the New York <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here we can see is dancing. <unk> <unk>
On the left left, you see <unk> <unk>
So it's so <unk> 3D <unk> 3D <unk> <unk>
It can just break the whole whole movement.
You can just go down all the way.
And once once we got the pixels the pixels can we can play with them, with color and movement, the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use it to use this as a possible input for <unk>
I wanted to show that the last project that we are working on. on.
It's something about the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, can you imagine is to imagine that, again, that we could engage people to do anything and change our <unk> environment as a <unk> farm <unk> <unk> <unk>
Imagine that we could do is all all get you a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what was remarkable that has happened in over the last two decades, decades, we have spent the physical world to the digital world.
We've <unk> <unk> everything, as knowledge is and is accessible to the Internet.
Today, you for the first time -- -- and the Obama <unk> we can move through the way of the digital world -- of the networks, <unk> <unk> <unk> to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and design a <unk>
That would mean it would be something that was built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be about to address the challenges of today: today: think about climate change the climate change in climate change, or climate change climate change in the climate change the climate change in climate change, or change the climate change in climate change, or climate change climate change in the climate change in climate change, or change the climate change in climate change, or climate change climate
The idea is that we can actually make people involved in doing this together, can do this do these all of our collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, a cloud, a <unk> made of pixels the same way that the actual cloud is the same way that the actual cloud is the same way that the actual cloud is the same way that the actual cloud is the same way that the actual cloud is the same way that the actual cloud is the same way that the actual cloud is the same
And these particles are water, water, while in our cloud of the cloud of the cloud
It's a physical structure in the London -- but covered the pixel up.
You can can move through the way inside, having different experiences.
You can can see from the bottom, you can have to share the main moments of the major Olympics of the major Olympics of the major Olympics of the major Olympics of the major Olympics of the major Olympics of the major Olympics of the major Olympics of the major Olympics of the major Olympics of the major Olympics of the major Olympics of the major Olympics of the major
So it's so much a kind of a physical cloud cloud of the sky as something that you can can go to go up as a new <unk>
You can go into there there.
As if we were a new digital <unk> of the night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody to go at the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than you're all about?
Suppose I would just tell you that with only matter about changes in its genes, much more precise, more accurate -- more faster.
Or maybe maybe you like to be in better way, it will be better as much more way, to make more <unk> more <unk>
Would you like to be more much more attractive and more secure and be more safe and sure it to ourselves?
What about to live more good to live more good with good health?
Or maybe be the people that they were always wanted to want to be more creative. in.
What are you most excited about to you about.
What do you want to do -- if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk>
How many people are going to think about creativity? creativity? creativity? How many people to do people about to do.
Hands up by hand.
<unk> <unk> probably owe the number number number of creative people present.
That's really good.
How many many of you want the memory?
A few more.
And the <unk>
A little bit <unk> bit.
How about the <unk>
Oh well, most people do make me feel a good way as a medical doctor.
If you could have to have something about this the world the world would be very different.
It's just <unk> <unk>
Or maybe be that possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> <unk> theme here at the TED TED TED conference TED -- but today I want to give you the look at a doctor in the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But if you actually embrace biological evolution consider this: this is just about past, or the future?
It's about the other or other <unk>
This is another look looking at the tree of life.
The human part of the human part of this branch, good at one is, of course, that we are most interested in.
It was a <unk> <unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees modern chimps about six or eight million years ago.
In the interval, there has been maybe 20 or 20 different species of <unk>
Some of them have been and <unk> on.
We've been here been here been here been here been here.
It might seem like we're very far away from other from other parts of this tree of life life life, but actually, in its most majority of the basic machine machinery of our cells are just about itself.
You can realize that we can harness you and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein protein protein is used to treat <unk>
This is not like how much as human <unk> are human <unk> but it's the same protein, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- -- you all have all have all take in the most more bacteria that the cells that we have in the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- think about ... -- do think -- think -- think -- think -- -- when Antonio <unk> <unk> you know what about <unk> <unk>
So the gut gut is is a kind of a wonderful thing to do this is bacteria bacteria.
It's the dark, dark, dark is <unk> <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients the nutrients that you can want to without any effort in part.
It's really just like a quick time for the bacteria to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> out.
But by the other thing, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life. life.
They can they help digest water nutrients out <unk> <unk> <unk>
But what are we going to tell us with the future?
We're in a kind of kind of evolutionary balance evolutionary balance evolutionary research as a species? <unk>
Or race is meant to become a different thing, something might better <unk> be better adapted to the <unk>
In this very vast <unk> symphony of the universe, life on Earth is a short <unk> the animal kingdom, the animal kingdom -- and a single one and unique <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part <unk> of this talk, so I hope you've got to have it <unk>
When I just went back to college I was just going to college at college school, I had my first first kind of biology.
I was very fascinated by the elegance <unk> and the beauty in biology.
I fell in love with love with the power of evolution that of all, life life is in life, life life, in life life, in life life, in life -- in life -- in life -- in the life -- in life -- in the life -- in the life -- in the life of life, the life of life, in life life, in the life of life, the life
But when these organisms appear to come on, are the way up, all the things that things begin to change.
It goes up in the scene sexual reproduction.
And a very important thing: with the emergence of the sexual reproduction -- the genome is going on the genome, the rest of body becomes <unk> <unk>
In fact, one could be say that the death <unk> <unk> come up in evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction comes in.
I have to <unk> that when I was a college student was like, was like, was like, thought, well, would you <unk> <unk> death by <unk> it was quite reasonable at the time, but was going on, and had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in Las Vegas very well coming in in their 90 years.
And one night hits you hit her <unk> <unk>
He opens the door door.
In front of he is face in front of him is a gorgeous <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
He looks at it and she says, <unk> look for a <unk> <unk>
He <unk> says George, George, I choose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, that I was working on for a particular goal to the goal of the <unk> <unk> you don't necessarily just just just just just <unk> with just it.
I was just trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to healthy you healthy.
I wanted to regain health care in the disease.
I wanted to live living in live into a healthier way.
Evolution is to happen is going to spend the same genome is going to spend the way next to the next <unk> adapt to <unk> <unk> <unk> generation generation.
From one of us from an evolutionary point of evolutionary view is evolutionary evolutionary evolutionary evolutionary view you and myself are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to send the genetic burden the genetic burden the genetic burden the genetic burden the genetic burden the genetic burden the genetic burden the genetic burden the genetic burden the genetic burden the genetic burden the genetic burden the genetic burden the
I think we all <unk> the feeling that you applied to Woody Woody -- when he said, "I don't just like to make immortality immortality immortality aids.
I want to <unk> <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily favors favors for longevity.
They were not necessarily favors the biggest or stronger or stronger <unk> <unk> <unk>
Evolution favors early creatures better matched into their environment.
That's that one is the only survival test and success.
In the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the ocean of the ocean of the ocean of the ocean the ocean <unk> <unk> that you can survive to the heat of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> if there were fish that there are fish you there, there a fish there, there, fish fish <unk> <unk> <unk>
So what does this mean is, when we look at what is happening on in the same time of humans in humans in the humans in the human humans in the humans in the humans in the humans in the human humans in the humans in the humans in the humans in the humans in the human humans in the humans in the humans in the humans in the human
The first one is that we don't have to <unk>
We've got to get a kind of kind of balance.
And the underlying thought that underlying that is that that is that that is that that is that that is that that is that that is that that is that that is that that is that that is that that is that that is that that is that that is that that is that that is that that is that that is that that is that that is that that
And secondly, we as a species -- have <unk> <unk> <unk> our environment so that we adapt we adapt to it.
And by the way, we <unk> <unk> <unk> us and <unk> us so much that it's no longer possible to have the need that we can have the necessary amount of isolation that evolution is happening.
A second second possibility is that is going to make a form of the form of the traditional <unk> natural type, natural <unk> <unk> dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that is that that the gears of evolution are going to slow slowly slow down.
And as soon as we were to <unk> it when we were <unk> to <unk> it when as a kind of <unk> <unk> planets -- are going to exist the isolation and the environmental changes that we can produce natural evolution look like.
But there is a third third third third third new possibility, one possibility -- and terrifying as terrifying one.
I call this <unk> new evolution -- that is just <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and elected people as individuals in the decisions that we had.
Now, how could this might happen this happen?
How could we be able to do this?
First, consider the reality that many many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are having more have more men who is more than women.
It's not really good for society for society, the society is, to the individual level and familiar.
Think about what it could be possible to be possible possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to choose not only be only the sex of their <unk> <unk> but in your own body to make genetic adjustments adjustments adjustments <unk> to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could do is to do the gene changes to remove about diabetes or remove about diabetes cancer risk cancer or remove it.
You wouldn't want to make those changes on your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of change is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Human Human Project, Human Human Project, Human Human Project, Human Project Project, Human Project <unk> started in 1990 and she used 13.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year the year next year, I finished, in 2004, it could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three -- four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence from the three million base pairs of base pairs of base pairs of the human genome at one cost close to <unk> <unk> <unk>
Don't I get a lot to a lot very long way to make the human genome for <unk> <unk> <unk> and be increasingly much more to the amount of time.
They come to get those changes.
The same technology that has produced up in human bacteria can do viruses that we're not only going to be able to be able to induce immunity.
<unk> or there is no one of experimental experimental <unk> experimental trials in the course with the flu <unk> experimental <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it grows in cells from a plant plant.
Can you imagine a good thing to come out of the <unk>
That's reality today and in the future you and more possible.
Imagine then only only other two <unk> <unk>
You can can change the cells of their bodies they could but could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could could change the sperm and be <unk> it or change the <unk> <unk> <unk> more chance of a more successful life of a more healthy life of a more healthy life is a more chance of a more good life of a more good life of a more healthy life is a much more chance of a much more successful life of a more healthy life
Who doesn't not want the kids more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology <unk> <unk> -- that same motor is changes to prevent disease disease is going to be also going to allow us to do that we have to take a lot of <unk> <unk>
Why not you have to have the ingenuity of a research Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you not have have to have have a have to have a have to have a have to have a have to have that have a have have have to have a have to have the have a have to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> allow us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not not live in live longer?
This is <unk> <unk>
And when we're going to be working on to happen to happen to the next generation and we can embrace the attributes that we want to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to
We're going to take a process process, that you could can normally take 100 thousand years back, and we can rotate it to a 1,000 years, and maybe maybe happen within the next 100 hundred years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, <unk> or grandchildren of their grandchildren, <unk> are going to have to them.
We're going to use it use these options in a way way of a better society better, more <unk>
Or are we going to choose a different different attributes that we want for some of us but for some of us but do for some of us but do for the others?
We're going to just build a society that is more boring and more robust and <unk>
This is the kind of a question we got to face.
And the most profound thing of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and to <unk> <unk> the wisdom necessary necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or badly, and before what could be <unk> -- are able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do, and
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at about <unk> <unk>
Imagine an airplane full <unk>
Imagine a engine <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day -- was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one that I could talk about with <unk> <unk>
So I immediately immediately looked at it, and said, "No problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot was already <unk> on the plane, and we were not so far away.
You could see about Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The <unk> pilot was the <unk> pilot off, the plane <unk>
Often that's not the way.
It will just take the motors.
Imagine being a plane and <unk> <unk>
And then he said three three words -- ...
The three more <unk> words I've ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to have to talk about my <unk> more with the <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes, eyes.
It was a terror. <unk> life <unk> <unk>
I want to share with you three three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything is all going on in an instant.
We have this list of things that I wanted to come and wanted to come to -- and didn't, all all the way I wanted to do that I want to get to come in, and didn't do that, -- all all all have to do that I want to get to get it, and didn't, all all the way I wanted to do that I want to get to
As long as I was thinking about later on, and come up a sentence, which is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because if the wine is ready, and the person is there, I'm going to going to open.
I just don't want to do is anything to do with you guys for <unk> <unk>
And this is really really really changed my life.
The second thing I learned about -- -- -- and this is that day -- is <unk> -- the bridge George <unk> Washington, which was not very much -- think about, -- -- <unk> <unk> <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to better improve myself better.
But in my humanity also give you place to my <unk>
And I'm sorry about the time you <unk> -- in things that really did not care about with people that people matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my relationship with my friends, friends, friends, friends.
And then, as a <unk> in that, we decided to remove the negative energy in negative life.
It's not perfect, but but it's a lot better thing.
I didn't have had a fight with my wife.
It feels about <unk>
I'm no longer trying to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The third third thing I learned -- -- -- and this is how your mental <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk> <unk>
I don't want this to do this is you do this is you for this is it you do this is this is it be break in 20 pieces of them in those <unk>
And as I <unk> it was a sense of, sense of, -- -- -- death is not fear.
It's pretty much as we've been to <unk> for it all our entire lifetime.
But it was very sad.
I didn't just want to be a <unk> <unk> I love my life.
And that's the <unk> <unk> <unk> in a single thought, thought, that is, I just want one thing.
I wish I could see I can see that I can see my children <unk>
One month later, I was at a performance of my <unk> <unk> first grade, you very much much to artistic <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
And to me, that was all the whole reason for the world in the world.
At that point, I got to connect with those two points points, that the only matter matter in my life is to be a great father.
All over the time, the only goal I got in life in life is to be a good parent.
I was given to gave a miracle of a miracle, wouldn't die that day.
And he was another gift to to look at the future and go back to live differently. out.
You who are flying out flying out flying up today -- the challenge to imagine that you can imagine that it is on your plane -- you for not that -- -- but imagine, -- and how do you <unk> it?
What are you going to <unk> you guys who are still going to do, do because they think they're going to be living on.
How will it change change is change and can change your relationships for negative <unk>
And most importantly, they are being the best parents to <unk> out.
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in the life with many many different projects. projects.
But the most great thing I worked was working on was for this point.
The guy is called <unk> <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> <unk> <unk>
A day one day he came home to his house after the running run, and he was running around and run and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> on <unk>
And that was the very early beginning of the beginning of the ALS.
Today, I <unk> it has a complete <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I got a design design design design and animation and animation -- obviously the graffiti -- is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we decided we were going to get it to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
So I went and met with his brother brother and his father and said, "Let's give you to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just I want to be able to talk about Tony again. again.
I just want to be able to communicate with communicate with communicate communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate communicate with communicate communicate communicate communicate communicate communicate communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate with communicate
And I said, "A second one is not that you see -- see this <unk> <unk> <unk> is not that all all people have paralysis with paralysis paralysis they with paralysis with <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be very important to you are important to be important and have good good at you can't actually do it.
These devices are not available for people."
And I said, "Well, how are they communicate then?"
Did you have seen the film to film -- the movie <unk> and <unk> <unk>
They communicate it to the way, they are going writing on the way.
I said, "That's <unk> <unk> How can it be?"
So I was presented with a single desire to deliver a check, and rather than that sign a look at a check that I had had no idea how to <unk>
I was inspired by her <unk> <unk> and his father at right now, time, "Oh, this is the <unk> Tony <unk> -- this is the <unk> Tony <unk> we're going to go to build a machine, and that you can make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who is so much in inside of you.
So I was talking about a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> <unk> Research <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that have a technology that allows them to project a light light on on any surface and and then have a light light on on any surface and and then have a light light on into any surface and and then have a light light on into any surface and and have a
So they go out there making art facilities like this.
All all the things that we <unk> <unk> they say, are part part of a part of a life cycle.
They first started to start with with the <unk> the sex organs, the bad words after the attacks of Bush -- Bush and finally do art.
But there was always a life cycle in <unk>
And so he started the journey.
And just about two years later, about one year later, after a lot of a lot of moving things back to one side of the things that one side one side of the things that one side one side of the things that one side one side of the things that one side one side of the things that one side one side of the things that one side one
One, I played the doors in the insurance insurance insurance insurance insurance insurance insurance insurance insurance insurance insurance insurance insurance insurance insurance insurance insurance companies, and we got a machine to <unk> <unk> I was able to get a <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The other thing we did was doing is actually bring seven of seven all the entire <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
My wife, kids and moved to the garage back back to the garage back back, and these hackers and <unk> and <unk> they took control in the house.
Many of our friends thought that we were to do is something that was completely stupid and that when they were going to have the pictures of the walls in the walls and just like <unk> <unk>
But during two of two weeks, we were going to go back up with <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They're a couple of <unk> <unk> of the cheap sun <unk> have cheap <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We took a <unk> camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on on a light light, and you now is there a device <unk> -- we published this is we published -- we publish the code <unk> <unk> the software <unk> <unk>
And we created a device old device that it has no limitation at all.
There's no big company <unk> I mean <unk>
There's no hospital hospital that <unk> <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much thank you very much of you very much much for you.
So, at the last two weeks, we went back back into the <unk> room room.
I love this picture because this is a other one, and that is the other person in another person, and that is his room.
There was all this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And after a year one year of planning, two weeks to tried to do with dinner at all the night, Tony <unk> first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the life support system of your life and is looking through from the life support system.
We ran to the bed the bed the bed the bed the bed the bed the bed the bed the bed the bed the <unk>
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking parking lot outside the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- -- and you can can imagine what is the feeling in parking <unk>
The funny thing is, we had to take out in the parking lot as much as if we were <unk> the graffiti -- as well.
At the end of this that he was just told us to us be an email up into the stage, and this was what was like, "This is the first time it was in seven seven years.
I felt like how would I have have have have been just under the water and a person to come up to <unk> and get me out there to make it <unk>
It's not <unk>
And in a certain way, that is our war <unk>
That's what keeps us in the movement, we've developing.
And we have a long way to go through with this.
It's a cool device but the equivalent of a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential to deserves a lot more much more.
So we're now trying to figure out how to change it, and make it faster and make it faster and do it and be faster and <unk>
Since we have have all have all have all have all have all kinds of all recognition.
We won many many many prizes. We've won many projects.
Remember, it's a <unk> <unk> none of us are doing money on with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets. <unk>
<unk> were like <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, last magazine called us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- -- -- -- -- and this is what ends out of close up close to closing the <unk> that is April in April of this year in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is going to be an exhibit called <unk> on the <unk>
And you <unk> in <unk> <unk> it is going to have the have the best <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is going to be in the show which is quite quite quite quite pretty amazing.
So basically this is basically be my idea: if you can see something that it's not possible as possible, as possible.
Nothing of you in this room was that there is in this room was this room was possible as possible as the -- the computer, the microphone, the <unk> -- nothing was possible for the time.
Do you know anything about this room.
I'm not a programmer, never did anything with <unk> recognition technology recognition, I just recognized something and get me very excited to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want to all do is all do we all do all the days of days when we can find you with something that you need to do is that you feel like to do is, -- -- and if not do me, remember it now. for.
Thank you, guys. Thank you.
I've spent last last <unk> <unk> <unk> are usually really hard to and at the same time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked on in a dangerous <unk> mine.
It was in the <unk> zones difficult and hard and dangerous.
And I spent a whole 30 days of just this -- really fun to the very beginning, something really hard in the middle, very dangerous at the very end.
In fact, in great part of my career <unk> me in me in the way in sort of sort of sort of in the situations in horrible appearance, in the social issues of ways that <unk> <unk> <unk> interesting -- and forth to see them in a way that you would like to be neat and accessible <unk> <unk>
So when I knew I was going to come here to do a TEDTalk TEDTalk around the world -- the brands -- and <unk> <unk> and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you can have heard it, or not, a few weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent up some messages on Facebook Facebook, some few on Twitter, I volunteered to sell it in the name of the name of my TED <unk> <unk>
What was what the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk TEDTalk that you have no idea about what it is really about to is it about and as much idea what is going to be about -- in face, it in the face that it is what is it and as much idea what is going to be all about -- on the face --
But said this is a very good <unk> <unk>
Do you know how many people look at the <unk>
<unk>
It's a title for a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> <unk> I know that somebody was going to buy the name of name.
If you would have have been a year ago, I could was able to do it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, and looked at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as I said earlier, I got myself in my way in horrible situations in the last few years, but got me to me for something that hard as hard to go into rooms with these guys.
You see, I can see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is <unk> <unk> of products, the marketing and advertising, and all all the entire name is film -- with <unk> product products and products, and marketing and <unk> and advertising.
The film is going to call "The <unk> <unk> <unk>
What happens in "The biggest <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> <unk> the film for the time.
And this is the film -- look at this whole whole whole whole sense, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the have the have is only have have the have is only have have the have the have the is just going to have the have the is just going to have the have the is just going to have the have the is just going to have the have the is just going to have the have the is just going to
Maybe you get a whole shoe shoe and get the all the biggest shoe that you <unk>
The most cool car is going to <unk> in "The largest <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of "The <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then going to show you the marks as part of the life, life, make them that we have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The goal of the film is that the film is that the film is that the film is that the film is that the film is that the film is that the film is that the film is that was film is full is transparency.
You're going to see all the whole process in this film.
That's the complete complete idea -- all the whole shot -- just end.
And I would just love you to help me help me -- help me make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, that's funny because it's funny because it's the first time I hear -- is the most respect for the audience.
<unk> I don't just not know how to <unk> go to the people do.
<unk> You got a <unk> -- -- don't you <unk> it's very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> money you need to do this?
MS: One million and a half thousand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I think it's going to going to be hard for the meeting with to the meeting, but that is certainly going to be worth you going to be worth having to convince a couple of big ones.
<unk> Who knows, you know, probably for the time that comes out of the film -- look like a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> long.
MS: So what do you think is going to think it's going to do is the be the <unk>
Stuart <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: But but it's going to be hard to <unk> for the film -- or be I?
JK: So I'm both both things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need a help.
MK: I can help.
MS: Very good <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
MK: We need to have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. You <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Is that that's the <unk> -- when you look at the people that you have to have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where I'm going to go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: And I thought to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> have a conversation outside the way out.
<unk> <unk> means we not want to know about know anything about your <unk>
MS: And it's one one for one, all these companies all of a sudden suddenly stop.
None of no one who had to have have had to have anything to do with this film.
I was very surprised.
They didn't want to know about know anything with this project.
And he was very <unk> I thought about the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk> was to present as many people as possible as possible, to make many people to see it as much as possible.
Especially in the world today this is today this is really tell with that new vehicle is to tell with that new vehicle is going to tell with that new vehicle is going to tell with that new vehicle is going to tell with that new vehicle is going to tell with that new vehicle is going to tell with that new vehicle is going to tell with that new
No, that was what I would think.
But the problem was, you can see, that my idea had a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Actually no, there was not such a really mistake.
There was there not a mistake at at all.
This would have have been good at it.
But the problem was really about represents this picture.
See, you can see, when you look for images of <unk> you in Google <unk> <unk> <unk>   -- this is one one of the first images that shows up.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> <unk> Sergey <unk> <unk> Sergey <unk> <unk>
So this was the problem: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> easily <unk> easily be characterized by the visibility visibility of the visibility visibility or visibility out of the last line right -- maybe the last line problem.
You see, you can see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> <unk> the president <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But suddenly we suddenly do is how to make it actually make it actually make it really something that really happen.
But why? Well, transparency gives you --  --  -- --  -- like that bear weird <unk> <unk>
It's <unk>    Like this <unk> <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's really risky.
When I started to talk to the companies and talk to companies and tell you that we want to tell this story and said, "No, we want to do we want to do you want to do that we have a story <unk>
We want to make a story to <unk> a story, but that we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
See, I can see, when I was a kid, and my father <unk> me on me as as a single <unk> -- say, "Son, are you looking at as one as used to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> three sides in every story.
Is it your story, there is my story, and is the <unk> <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film film -- just like to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a company, an agency wanting to -- -- and -- just because I know John <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- many years -- I realized that I would have to have to do -- have a lot -- -- many years -- I realized that I would have to have to do -- have a lot -- -- many years -- I realized that I
So what I started to sort of a sudden, of a sudden of a sudden all of a sudden all of a sudden all of a sudden all of a sudden all of a sudden all of a sudden all of a sudden all of a sudden all of a sudden all of a sudden all of a sudden all of a sudden all of a sudden all of a
MS: So I have a friends for friends that do big, large big <unk> big, giant <unk> big, giant <unk> big, giant <unk> big <unk> <unk> <unk> small <unk> <unk> <unk>
And my friends who are doing with Hollywood movies for big, big Hollywood Hollywood <unk> giant Hollywood <unk> giant Hollywood <unk> say the reason your movies got so much successful for the <unk> <unk> they are.
And then my friends who do independent films are going to go to do with these big, giant <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the film is called "The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How are we going to look specifically at <unk> <unk> in the film?
Every time I'm going to go out, out, every time I open up my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview one of an interview one with somebody that you're really good for this <unk>
You <unk> <unk> You look a little bit nervous.
I want to help you know what are you <unk> you guys.
Maybe you should get a little bit bit about this before <unk>
And there we offer one of these <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were just going to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have that much for man for man for man like to <unk> it on the bar, as a be.
That's that that is general <unk>
Now I can answer your question up, and give you a <unk> look at <unk>
Karen Wow. We are a little little brand child.
We were going to look at the kind of the smaller movies more little <unk> more little <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we don't have have have have have have have have have have have have have have have the have have have the have have have the have the have the have have the have the have the have have the have the budget have other brands.
So do we do things like that, you know, -- you know, show you, are people going to ask people is why we're going to focus on.
MS: So what words would you use to use it for <unk> <unk>
<unk> is a white <unk>
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: U.N.
MS: Technology is not the way that you want to describe something that you can put in the <unk>
Man: So we talked about something <unk> <unk> <unk>
I think about <unk> is a great word that really actually put in this category in positive <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It keeps you very cool.
How do you keep us to keep us cool you very cool out of us that are more <unk> more <unk> more <unk>
Things like these things like those <unk> <unk>
MS: And that's that one is a <unk> company <unk>
What about what about me? <unk> what are there about a common guy about is about a common guy.
I need to talk to the man from the street, the people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand. <unk>
MS: How do you define you your <unk> <unk>
Man: <unk> <unk> My <unk> <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Volunteer: revive the '80s, we <unk> <unk> unless it be a day <unk>
MS: All right, that's okay, what is the brand <unk> <unk>
<unk> One is unique <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I guess the type of <unk> the kind of <unk> the kind of <unk> the kind of the kind of <unk> the kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I like a lot very dark colors, many gray gray and things like this.
And they usually take a sound <unk> <unk> <unk> I like the <unk> <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: Two: The brand I am, -- -- <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 3: 3: Four 3: I am the kind of the pet particles.
<unk> toys for pets they <unk> in the country and world.
So I guess I guess that's my <unk> <unk>
In my little little sector, little sector, little sector, child, that's my brand.
Man 4: 4: manipulative.
Man 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5: 5:
Is that anything? anything?
<unk> So I'm a <unk> brand <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk> <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all all be all that we can all be all that we can all all be that we can all all be that we can all all be that we can all all be that we can all all be that we can all all be that we can all all be that we can all all be that we can all all be that we
I realized that I needed an expert.
I needed somebody to go into in my head, your head, someone who could help me to understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called a company called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They helped companies as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If you could can surely be able to do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family picture.
AT: Tell me a little bit bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of your sense of your way.
MS: These people shape my way to look at the world.
I wanted me for that world.
MS: That means your world is -- think that your world is to think about your world is the world that they <unk> around you, around you, us, your friends, your family, the way that you live live in, live in.
All all of those things come in and start into a place and start in and start in and start in and start in in my family, family.
A: well, what is the next one you want to talk about to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life." <unk>
AT: How does this relate to you with your thoughts, feelings and be able to be?
MS: It's like who I wanted to be.
I like the different things.
I like all weird things weird stuff. I like all about weird things.
AT: Tell me how to do do do you mean for us do that?
What is the <unk> What phase is <unk> <unk> you find <unk>
Why is it important -- <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit bit about that.
You just get a little bit more about you, which is not that who you are.
What are other <unk> <unk> you <unk>
There is you have to have to have there is there have it have be good <unk> What kind of mountain Russian <unk>
MS: All <unk> <unk> Thank you.) <unk> Thank you.) <unk> <unk> Thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. <unk> Big <unk> Big <unk> <unk> Great <unk> <unk> Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to go out of this.
There was a lot about crazy about all this.
<unk> <unk> The first first thing I saw was seeing is this idea that there are two different sides here, but put in on your personality in your personality <unk> <unk> <unk> brand marks <unk> <unk>
They were very <unk> very well together.
And I think there is almost an almost a paradox in them.
And I think some of some companies are only focused on in one one of their strong dots <unk> <unk> <unk> in the other instead of focus on both.
Many companies tend -- -- -- and it's nature that we have to avoid the things that you're not going to avoid fear, those elements are actually <unk> <unk> you and get into love with you, for you, and do for you, and you can look at that.
What are other brands <unk> this?
The first one here is the the classical Apple Apple.
And you can also see is also to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now there are now there is now have these <unk> brands and brands -- all the things that have been and come and come and come in, and come in, and come and come in, and come and come in, and come in, and come and come in, and come in, and come and come in, and come in, and come and come in, and come and come in, and
MS: A whole <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If someone is ask you to do is you get to take your identity at your brand, identity, identity identity, what would that be?
You're you about an <unk> <unk> You are someone who makes your blood <unk> <unk>
Or are you be a more good one an <unk> <unk>
<unk> a little bit <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> attributes are you like to be playful -- to be playful to be playful to be playful to be playful to be playful to be playful to be playful to be playful to be playful to be playful to be playful to be playful and playful is going to be playful -- to be playful to be playful and playful is going to be playful to be playful
Or are you rather be the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Are you very sophisticated as <unk> <unk>
You're in the traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're more stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, wait, stable, you -- stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, you stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, you know, family -- -- stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, you get a stable stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, a stable -- stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, you get a stable stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, much -- stable,
In the course of this film film -- film we had over 500 companies, <unk> <unk> and <unk> they didn't want to become part part of the part of this project.
They did not have to have any have have have to have any have have have to have any have have have to have any have have to have any have have have to have any have have have to have any have have to have any have have have to have any have have have to have any have to have any have have have to have any have
So we were allowed to tell the story of the <unk> <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie film -- how now we use MRI magnetic resonance is magnetic resonance <unk> magnetic resonance is magnetic resonance resonance resonance resonance resonance magnetic resonance is magnetic resonance resonance resonance resonance resonance magnetic resonance is <unk> <unk> to identify the centers of desire in the desire centers in the
We went to San <unk> San Francisco Paulo <unk> where about advertising advertising to the open.
Over the last five five years, there is no <unk> no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school school companies that business are companies going going to become way way back into schools of food problems.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects in which I've have the biggest answer or know that I had most success are more successful are those people that I've been talking about, with things directly.
And that's what did these brands.
<unk> <unk> took their <unk> out, say, maybe maybe these agencies do not have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to make something something different, something that is going to do is to think about people, that is challenging the way we looking at the world.
And how is it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, since I heard from the film that movie was film at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
According to the film -- this film was <unk> on January, and since -- and -- this is <unk> <unk> we have had 900 <unk>
This is cover just a <unk> period of two of two weeks of two weeks.
That's just about <unk> <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk> up.
It's not online online, <unk> <unk>
It was not even presented in other other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already been started to <unk> <unk>
And it's not bad that because almost all the agencies that we are talking about, to love their customers won't <unk>
I've always believed if you <unk> if you <unk> if you take risks, that you take risks, that you have a risks, you take risks, that you have a risks, you take risks, that you have a risks, you take risks, that you have a risks, you take risks, that you have a risks, you take risks, that you have a risks, you take risks, that you have a risks,
I think when you take a lot of people that is pushing them to failure.
I think when you train your employees at loss about loss about loss about loss about loss about loss about loss about loss about loss about loss about loss about loss about loss about loss about loss about loss about loss about loss about loss about loss loss loss about loss averse to loss about loss about loss about loss about loss about loss about loss loss loss about loss
I feel that what has to happen is going to happen to move forward is we have to encourage people to <unk> people.
We have to encourage people that people are not afraid of the people that they don't have to be afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we're going to go forward, and I think we have to have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do
We have to have that bear bear in a cage.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
From one <unk> <unk> we have to take the risk at risk.
And ultimately, we have to have to have we have to have that we have to have to have the transparency.
Even more than a little bit of honesty is going to go down a long way.
And said this, with honesty and transparency, all my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> great data in large opportunities for companies all around the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So Cohen: So, I got to go on in behalf of the transparency, that happened exactly about <unk> <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question question remarkable question.
In my pocket pocket -- the name of the TED TED <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The idea behind the Gordian worm <unk> <unk> <unk> actually is really very simple.
We don't want to get Iran to get the nuclear bomb up.
Its biggest asset building to develop nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons is the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The gray boxes that are see are real control systems in real time.
If we can compromise to compromise with these systems that we control speeds and <unk> we can do a lot of problems with <unk> problems.
The gray boxes don't use software <unk> <unk>
But if we got to put a <unk> virus on Windows one of a portable computer used by an engineer to set in set up into this gray, gray, gray, ready.
This is the <unk> <unk>
We started with one <unk> <unk>
The <unk> come along in the gray box gray box off, the <unk> <unk> and nuclear nuclear program is <unk> <unk>
It's easy, <unk> <unk>
So I want to tell you how to do we find this is how do we discover what do we find this. this.
When we started to research for <unk> <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is is that it's very, very complex at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> <unk> these systems of control systems.
That was really called up the attention attention, and we started an experiment into our environment with <unk> <unk> -- and we see what was going to do with this.
So they were going to get very weird things. things.
<unk> <unk> <unk> like a lab from lab that it doesn't just like -- <unk> the wave, the wave, but he didn't not to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then we were to experience with different kinds with different flavors of cheese, the cheese, I realized, and thought, this -- this is this one <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> are actively looking at active in the gray box in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program program program program is trying to to infect infect infect infect in.
If no <unk> <unk> do nothing.
So that's what I called out called my attention, and start working on this almost 24 hours of a day, because we -- we don't know what is the <unk>
It could be, let's say for example, for example, for example, for example, a power of power in the United States, or a chemical plant plant in in Germany.
Better things going to be able to get away with the goal up soon.
So then we got up to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and we discovered that I was <unk> in two <unk> <unk> <unk> small <unk>
We can also see that were very armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed armed
They will all get all the dots that they could attack.
You probably even know about how much would we <unk> the operator.
So they know about everything.
And if you have heard that the <unk> <unk> are <unk> it's complex and high-tech <unk> <unk> let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much about top about everything we've ever seen before.
Here you see here is a sample of this code of attack that attack.
We're talking about about all about 15,000 lines of code.
It's pretty much like to the old <unk> <unk> old language.
I want to tell you how to we really find sense that sense of this code.
What we were looking to at the beginning, they were first going to were looking at the beginning, they were first going to were looking at first first they were first looking at first of them people were called to function of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking to <unk> and structures of data and tried to address it, with the real world -- with the real world, with potential future goals of the real world.
We need to really tell that we need to do that we need the <unk> theories that we can pass to do it or <unk>
In order to come to theories of the goals of goals goals of goals of goals of goals that we remember is definitely a violent <unk> that has to be a <unk> white <unk> you're ever located located in Iran -- because of the most majority of the infections have been <unk> <unk>
You don't find several many thousands of targets in that area.
It basically goes down to the plant <unk> nuclear energy plant <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I called them up in a way effort out to <unk> their experience experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to be able to associate with a little <unk> digital <unk> <unk>
The rotor is that piece of mobile phone a mobile phone phone in the <unk> that black object can see.
If if you run the speed for this particular <unk> you can certainly be able to go on, and even have the <unk> <unk>
And what we also was seen here is that the goal of the attack was going to see is that that the attack of the attack attack was attack was that is that the goal of the attack was attack was going to see is this is slow do slow slow up slow and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And we're trying to figure out to figure the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and and structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> <unk> out in that code, you can get it out.
So I started to started to research scientific literature on scientific literature about how these <unk> are <unk> are <unk> <unk> what is called a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, was a coincidence.
And it was a better time <unk>
These <unk> Iran are <unk> <unk> in 15 <unk> 15 different <unk> <unk>
And guess what are we in the <unk> code.
An <unk> <unk> <unk>
So again, that was a good coincidence.
And this is really much trust to understand what we had to do with our hands.
So let me not <unk> be <unk> not like this.
The results have results have been coming up in a number of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Yet, we found that both two two digital <unk> <unk> were going to just one and same goal, and but from all different <unk>
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> bit of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> big <unk> <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident to have we've determined what is the <unk>
It's <unk> it's a <unk> <unk> it's just <unk> <unk>
We should not worry about other targets are <unk> <unk>
Here I just show you some very interesting things that we were just just just just just -- just just got to come in.
There is the gray box gray box and the top <unk> look at the <unk>
What is what this thing is doing is to do is this is the input values values for <unk> sensors -- and pressure sensors -- and provides them code <unk> <unk> which is still run in during the <unk> <unk>
And believe it or not, this is this kind of false entry input fake entry is <unk> <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a great <unk> <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only be <unk> to the operators in the <unk> room room.
It's really much more dangerous to <unk>
The idea is <unk> <unk> <unk> a great digital security.
We need to need digital security care systems in where a human operator could could do quickly.
For example, in a energy plant, the energy plant, the big <unk> <unk> <unk> is going to open up speed, <unk> <unk>
Obviously, this can can't do is a human operator in a human operator.
That's where we needed digital security digital safety systems.
And when you <unk> <unk> then you can get bad bad.
The plant plant <unk> can be <unk> <unk>
And I didn't have an <unk> no <unk> the <unk> system.
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
So what am I going to say is very much important.
Think about this. This is <unk> <unk>
It has nothing to do see, is <unk> <unk> <unk>
It could also work as well, for example, in a place of energy plant, energy plant, a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's <unk>
And you ain't got no <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You could also use to use conventional <unk> technology of these conventional <unk> <unk>
It will just use it as much as possible.
And if you made that, with what we are <unk> -- is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's the consequence that we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks are such a attacks are not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All of the green areas are all all with large <unk> <unk>
We must face to face the implications, very much as much better to us begin to do this is now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: So I got a question. I got a question.
<unk> has public be public in many many sides of the people that people assume that is <unk> -- is the main connections of this.
What is your <unk> <unk>
Ralph <unk> <unk> Okay you really want to hear this?
Yes. <unk>
My guess is the <unk> are involved, involved, but but the engine is <unk>
The engine is behind this is the <unk> <unk>
There's one one, and that's that is the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, in the other way, our problems might be even older now.
CA: Thank you thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk> <unk>
I want you to imagine you to imagine you to imagine you to imagine you to imagine you to you can imagine you can you imagine you can imagine you to imagine is you to imagine you to imagine you for you to imagine is you to imagine you to imagine you for you to imagine is you to imagine you to imagine you for you to imagine you to
In <unk> <unk> <unk> we call these robots <unk>
It's not all different than one is different about something that you put on in the morning, it gives you a big strength, a big strength, a big strength, a big strength, a big strength, a big strength, a big strength, a big strength, a big strength, a big strength, a big strength, a big strength, a big strength, a big strength, a big strength, a big strength, a big
It's actually the real integration of real integration of the man and and the machine.
But not only do only -- can it integrate it and connect with the universe and other <unk> <unk>
This is not an <unk> idea.
In order to show you now what we're all starting to start with talking about the American <unk> American soldier who, on average, average you have to take on on its back back up with their back back a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Obviously, this is lead to some major complications <unk> -- injuries in the back, the soldiers -- -- with <unk> <unk>
So we decided to look at this challenge challenge, and create a exoskeleton to create a exoskeleton that I could help to manage it.
So let me introduce you to introduce you introduce you to you introduce you the <unk> -- one or <unk> <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> <unk> I can rotate it for 90 pounds of the information <unk>
Their <unk> <unk> allows you to put in <unk> <unk> <unk> and running a big <unk>
And I can just see what I want to do, or do or where do I want to go, go, and then raise my force up into my force up.
We <unk> <unk> We're ready, ready, with our industrial office partner <unk> <unk> we got to produce this thing, this was new <unk> <unk> <unk>
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back up to the users of chairs. chairs. wheels of what I'm particularly passionate about passionate about.
There is there that is 68 for the 68 million million people roughly, about <unk> wheels of the world.
Like one percent of the entire population.
And this is a really conservative calculation a really conservative.
So we talked about something that happens very much often with very often, people were very young people with damage to their life -- is going to start their lives -- to the 20, 30 years -- <unk> a wall and a wall and <unk> <unk>
We are also talking about the population that you just multiply <unk> quickly.
Its only choice, a lot of times -- for a brain injury -- is -- -- is the <unk> <unk>
And this is like for the last 500 years, years, of the successful <unk> as I might recognize.
So we decided to start to start by writing a whole new chapter about mobility.
So let me introduce you to you introduce you to the <unk> that we are using Amanda <unk> <unk> <unk> who was 19 years ago he had a <unk> injury in the <unk> <unk> column that he was able to go back to walk for 19 years, even now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is just using our <unk> <unk> <unk>
It has some sensors.
It was completely not going to go on in the crutches the signals on the board, on board, on board on the back.
There are some batteries that they gave the motors in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and do it move forward with this very soft <unk>
AB: I was 24 in the top top of my life in my life when, for a strange <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a second <unk> I lost all feeling and all <unk> <unk> <unk>
Little <unk> time later, a doctor walked into the hospital, and said, <unk> <unk> you will never get a <unk>
That happened about 19 up 19 years ago.
And so I stole a lot to the last amount of sense of hope of my own.
<unk> technology is an adaptation <unk> allowed me to be learning about <unk> it cost the way down down into <unk> <unk> climb rocks and even ride on a hand.
But they haven't invented invented to me for walk, it until far.
Thank you.
EB: So you can see, we have the technology, we have the technology -- to just sit and talk with you.
It's in our hands, and all we have all the potential here to change future future future future future generations -- is not only about -- soldiers, they were to all and all all the same way to all all.
AB: Thank you. Thank you.
I just returned back back up in a one community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have the <unk> have <unk> they say to say hello, and design is the order of day -- where the fun is really serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> festival <unk> <unk> <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, you know for their cousins.
This is this is the world the entire rainforests in the rainforests of Congo.
<unk> are along with the chimpanzees, their most close relatives.
That means we all share with all share is we all share with a all share with an incredible ancestor a common ancestor -- an evolutionary <unk> an evolutionary man lived about about six years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known by their <unk> <unk>
But unfortunately, we made too much about emphasis out too emphasis out too emphasis on in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show you the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by the big <unk> <unk> <unk> society Bonobo is <unk> of females with power.
These guys have created something special <unk> because this leads to a very very tolerant society is very tolerant where the deadly violence is fatal hasn't <unk> yet.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> <unk> <unk>
They live on in the depths of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and has been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> <unk> one <unk> an extraordinary biodiversity of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, -- but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on a violent conflict that has been taken for decades of and caused almost as many deaths like the First <unk> World War.
No surprisingly, this destruction also also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> hunting and hunting and deforestation is not going to be able to fill into a stadium stadium stadium -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> really sure about that.
However, in this land of violence and <unk> you can hear a hidden laughter hidden <unk> <unk>
Who are these <unk> <unk>
We are known as the animal <unk> <unk> <unk> the love, don't <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and manage to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all of all problems of humanity have have all have all have all have all all have all the problems of humanity have all have all have all have all have all of all problems of humanity have all have all have all have all of all problems of humanity have all have all have all have all about problems of
By the <unk> people like humans, humans, they love to play throughout their entire lifetime.
Play is not just be just just a <unk> game.
For us and for them the game is very fundamental to establish ties bonds together and encourage <unk>
We are learning about <unk> <unk> and learn about the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and <unk> diversity diversity -- diversity diversity and diversity diversity
And when you look at the game game, game, the <unk> roots <unk> of the laughter, the dance -- and human ritual love.
The game is the glue is the glue together.
I don't know about how do you play you play in, but show you a couple of unique videos of only the wild the wild.
First, it's a game <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here we have a female one, and a young young male <unk> <unk>
Look at what she is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just think in this case you love this -- love this -- love this -- -- right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common is common as much both in human <unk>
And this video is really interesting because of us -- this video is really interesting because it shows how to bring things about bringing things unusual to bring things unusual about what to bring things unusual to bringing things unusual about the bringing elements unusual about to bring things unusual about what to bring things unusual to bring things unusual about what to bring things unusual to bring things unusual
But the game is <unk> <unk>
The game is <unk> <unk> can be a lot in many ways of which these are most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Maybe the place where are I <unk>
And I just want you to <unk> this is <unk> one is a <unk> a young woman, who is playing with with it with a <unk> water.
I think about what it is, we sometimes played alone, ourselves, ourselves, by ourselves, ourselves, ourselves, the limits of our inner worlds.
And that's that kind of playful curiosity that drives us to go to explore, help us explore, explore, to explore, and connect the unexpected connections them.
These are just small samples of the <unk> samples of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> us from our past and present.
But they also have have a secret to our future future, a future we have to adapt to a world more more difficult to greater creativity. <unk>
The secret is that the game is a game is the key key thing to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is all about is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt it close to a world that changes have to have to play.
But let's get a lot to the maximum time of game?
The game is not <unk> <unk>
The game is essential is critical.
For bonobos and humans for the same way, life is not just cruel to <unk>
When you look at least appropriate -- play, you can be able to be the most <unk>
So I wanted primates, primates, us to accept this gift of evolution and play it, -- creativity, creativity, creativity is and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I was in New York early York I was in New York early in in New York early York early York organization called a non-profit called <unk> Robin <unk> <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty <unk> <unk> <unk> fires as a Captain <unk> fire department have volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers are allies in a highly <unk> <unk> <unk> got to get to the <unk> very early fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember the <unk>
I was a second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of it.
But there was there that there was a little race to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain and find out what our task was.
When I first found the <unk> <unk> on a conversation with the owner that has certainly moved through one of the worst days of their life.
We were out in full night, she was standing out on the rain, <unk> <unk> in his lungs, <unk> <unk> <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer had just got to come up before me -- to -- -- --  --  --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  --

There was a lawyer or <unk> for the money that, during the rest of her life, life, I would have to tell the people that I entered in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk> <unk>
He said, <unk> <unk> I need I need that I need that I need to do with each other home.
I need you to <unk> <unk> fire, a fire, and bring this woman a woman <unk>
I <unk>
It was not exactly what I was hoping for, but got to go on the stairs, back at the end of the hall of the hall of the hall of the hall of the hall of the hall of the hall of the hall of the hall of the hall of the hall of the hall of the hall of the hall of the hall of the hall of the
I know what you're thinking about, but but I'm not a hero. hero.
I took my load up around the ladder around the ladder. I met my <unk> <unk> and the beautiful dog at the main door top.

A few hundred weeks weeks later the department received a <unk> letter from the <unk> house <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> brave effort ever shown to save their house.
The kindness that she looked at over the other one was that someone had had had ever reached a few shoes.

And you know what have we learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look in in this room room people that have been succeeded, -- or get -- to -- have to be able to do -- this is no wait.
Don't wait not wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have to have a little bit to <unk> <unk> right now.
We were running food on in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> park.
Are you mentors.
Not every day we are going to have the opportunity to save their lives -- but every day we're going to be able to influence your person's life. lives.
So I go up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> shoes.
Thank you.

Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may be strange -- that may be strange, strange, much, but but I'm a great one one of a particular block of one particular block.
The first of the very concrete blocks of particular is built in <unk> <unk> <unk> a very simple <unk> <unk> modules to concrete from concrete <unk> each other.
Very quickly, these became very quickly, these became very quickly, these became very quickly very quickly, these became very rapidly <unk> these became the most <unk> construction unit used in the world.
They are allowed us to build things that we can build up build bigger things that we, as buildings or bridges bridges -- a brick brick out.
Essentially, these blocks have got together into our time. time.
Almost a hundred years years later, in 1947, <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> brick <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, <unk> <unk> were <unk> all got all all the home.
It's estimated that it's been made about 400 a billion or 75 <unk> <unk>
You not have to be an engineer in a engineer to build these beautiful bridges <unk> <unk>
<unk> made it accessible. accessible.
<unk> I just took the particular block block, the particular block of particular the particular block of particular the particular block of particular the particular block of particular the particular block of particular the particular block of particular the particular block of particular the particular block of particular the particular block of particular the particular block of particular the particular block of particular the particular block of particular the particular
Meanwhile, exactly exactly that same year, in the Bell projects the next revolution was to <unk> <unk> the new building block.
The transistor is a single plastic unit of plastic <unk> <unk> <unk> us from a world of <unk> <unk> <unk> stacked up about others to a way to a world where everything was interactive.
And just like the <unk> block of particular -- the transistor is to create a much greater and much more complex and more complex circuit and more complex, a brick brick out.
But there's a <unk> difference -- <unk> the transistor was only for experts.
I will not personally not appreciate it that the building blocks together our time is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of how to bring the power of engineers of the engineers from the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how to work.
<unk> are electronics each other one with a specific function.
They're <unk> <unk> to be light, and light, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they are magnets. are come through communicate.
So you can't just put in place wrong in.
The bricks have an colors.
The green is the <unk> <unk> blue is <unk> <unk> the <unk> is the input and color of color <unk>
So you only need to assemble a blue blue with one green with a green green one, you can quickly begin to make larger circuits.
One blue one with blue one green is make light.
Can we put a button in the middle and and have this <unk> <unk>
If we change the button on a <unk> button here, a pulse, now we have a <unk> light.
We were going to get this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm going to just stop this.
So beyond the simple game -- are -- -- are really very powerful.
Instead of having you have to have <unk> <unk> connect and <unk> <unk> <unk> allow us to program this is using very simple gestures <unk>
To make a <unk> faster or slow down, you just go on this button button a button button faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> <unk> is that be a collection of growing.
We want all that all all the interactions in the world in the world <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> sounds, solar panels, you may -- solar <unk> <unk> <unk> everything is accessible.
We were given up to the kids to see them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how to you start to understand the electronics start to understand the electronics in all of the days you don't learn in in schools.
For example, how does one light is such a light light up night, or why the door is an an elevator an elevator an elevator an elevator an elevator an elevator an elevator an elevator an elevator an elevator an elevator an elevator an elevator an elevator an elevator an elevator an elevator an elevator is an <unk> you open up open, or how do you mean an iPod responds
We also also brought to apply it to the <unk> design schools.
So for example, designers without any electronic experience in some electronics start playing <unk> <unk> like a material.
Here you can see here you can see here, with paper bottles of paper and <unk> <unk> we got to <unk> <unk>
<unk>   A few weeks ago, we went back into the design <unk> design <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I don't have experience some experience with any of any experience in a engineering experience, only in cardboard, wood and wood and forth and wood and paper and forth, and wood and do something something.
Here's an example of a project that have been done, a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here is my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For those of these engineers, <unk> became another other material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to you all all.
So, <unk> has an open source.
You can visit the website, right page, download all all all the design <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, creators are inventors because this world is that we live, this interactive world we live in, -- this is to live in, this is interactive our world in.
So go ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries as today.
I work in the time in the solar technology in the human technology.
And my little little company looking for involved with the environment <unk>
<unk> distributed distributed collaboration.
This is a small clip that we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit bit about <unk>
We <unk> we can continue to continue better leave out the way up on to one end of.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Solar <unk>
Oh, I already know now that I have the term time to have time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and best designers for me to take a year -- and work in an environment that you are supposed to do, -- are asking them to work to work in the government.
The initiative was called <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> and would be like <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were going to get a few few members every year of the year, and put them working on with the <unk>
Instead of you start sending them the third World Third Third World Third Third World Third Third World Third World Third World Third World Third World Third World Third World Third World Third World Third World Third 2 World Third World Third World Third World Third World Third World Third World Third World Third World Third 2 World 2 World 2 World 2 World 2 World 2 World 2 World
They had big <unk> <unk> worked with the <unk> <unk>
Their task is about to show the possibilities of current technology today.
<unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk>
So here's what really does is that it's very good by taking fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How do you want to ask for the help come to help this be very <unk>
Last year, in Boston we had a team members of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were there in in there in the time we were going to have last last year.
You noticed the city never cleaned up <unk>
But one of the members members called called Erik <unk> something else else else else else else else else else else -- that the citizens would <unk> <unk> <unk> on the front of them.
So he did as a good programmer, good programmer, actually developed an app.
It's a nice application app that you can have to have to have that is going to get in.
You now is <unk> <unk> when do you <unk>
When you do that, you -- one -- in this case, it was <unk> <unk>
If you don't do that, you do it, you guys know it.
I mean, it has a component are fairly remains there.
It's a modest modest <unk>
Maybe it's the tiniest little bit small thing of the 21 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year.
But it's something about another other technology of the other technology of the is the <unk> <unk>
And it spreads on the viral. viral.
A responsible for systems of the city <unk> City, looking at this app realized that I could use it, it is not for the snow, it not for the snow, it is that that the citizens have <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's very important that it work to work this is how are these <unk> to <unk> <unk>
So that's why we asked the citizens to <unk> them.
And then she decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago was the Chicago just <unk> <unk> to get people to get off to clean sidewalks out to clean up.
So now we know now about nine of nine cities that plan using using using it.
And this is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and natural way.
If you know about a little bit bit about government technology in government technology -- government can know that this is normally happen about.
The acquisition of software is general takes a couple of years now.
Last year, in Boston we had a team working on a project that it took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for that the parents could choose to choose the best public school for their children.
And then we were to tell us that have been done by the normal channels it would have taken it for the normal channels it would have been going to have at least two years and just about two million dollars.
And that's not just nothing.
Now there's a project project in the court court power of California that even time has two million dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects that in every level of the government.
So this is an application application for a couple days of days, you <unk> <unk> in a viral form is viral it <unk> is viral it <unk> it's a kind of kind of kind of shot back warning at the institution as <unk>
It suggests the government better ways to work, work on, -- not like in private companies, people think it should be.
Not as a technological technological company, but as well as the Internet itself.
I mean, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that we can address the question of the question of the government is going to address the question of the point of the government about the point of the government is going to address the question of the point of the government is going to tackle the question of the point of the government about the point of the government is
And that's this very good because it turns out is that we are really good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who is building together to build the tools for us to do it together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> but there are hundreds of people all around the country country <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> every day in their own communities.
They're not not given up with the government.
You have a great frustration a great frustration to exactly that is, but don't we <unk> <unk>
And these people know something that we lost from view.
And that's what if we left out of the feelings about politics, about the politics, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all all those other things that we got crazy enough to <unk> the government is really <unk> -- the government is basically about words in the words of Tim <unk> us, the government is, in the words that we are crazy crazy -- -- government is essentially in words
Now, many people have left abandoned behind.
If you are one of those people are going to ask it, because things are going changing.
Politics is not going to <unk> government yes.
And because the last government is going to ultimately be -- -- remember that is <unk> -- the <unk> the way to think of this is how to make change.
I didn't not know a lot about a lot about government much about government much of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was thought about the government to choose to choose <unk> <unk>
Well, after two years I've got to have the conclusion that government government is, mostly about <unk>
This is this is the center of the phone care phone care for services and information information.
It is the place that the calls is typically calls the calls if you marks about 311 America.
Scott <unk> on call.
He went to <unk> on official official knowledge.
I did not find anything a little bit with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open up the door doors very hard and see if it <unk> out.
And it worked, it worked. So is Scott.
But that's not the end of the end of the <unk> <unk>
Boston is not a <unk> <unk>
It has a <unk> web <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Don't I hear that application.
It was the work of very clever people from the New <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
One day, this really happened now is really come on come up with this <unk> <unk> I was going to go on in my bucket <unk> I don't know if she's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> different.
Scott <unk> was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> <unk> public is all about, all all you can all see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor. <unk>
The next few next report say, <unk> I approached the place, I found out the garbage garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I turn around, the <unk> back home. home.
Good nights, sweet nights, sweet nights, sweet nights, sweet nights, sweet <unk> sweet nights, sweet <unk> sweet <unk> sweet time.
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the <unk> of digital digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of the government income of government income is a big distributed example.
But it's also a great example of government like platform.
And here I don't just mean about the definition technological <unk>
I'm talking about a platform for people to get themselves excited about, and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but one but here, the government had a key <unk>
connected to the two two people.
And it might be <unk> connected to the aid services of being needed -- but got to be able to connect it connected with the government services of being needed -- but got to be able to be able to connect it connected with the government services of being needed -- but got to be able to be able and connected to connect with the aid services of being needed
When one neighbor helps help each other other <unk> <unk> the communities.
If we call out to control the animals, it cost a lot very much much much money.
One thing important thing we need to have to have to think about the government is to think about the government is to think about the government is that it's not the same as the politics.
A lot of people really understand it, it, but think one is one one is the one of the input each other.
That our input system government system is a vote.
How many times have you have chosen a <unk> <unk> we had a <unk> <unk> we spend much much much much much more energy to pick a new political leader to choose a new political leader to choose a new political leader to choose a new political leader to choose a new political leader to choose a new political leader to choose a new political leader to choose a new
That's because of the government is that government be like an immense and immense ocean and the policy is the <unk> surface layer. layer.
So that's why we is what we called <unk> <unk>
And we say that word very word very much very long thing contempt.
But that's this <unk> <unk> what keeps us that is us that is that we finance as something that is something that is going to operate on in our against us that other thing, and as we all about losing power.
People think politics is <unk>
If we want to this institution work is work to do is that we have the <unk> <unk>
Because this is where the real work is happening happening where the real government happens.
We have to have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement <unk>
They've <unk> them <unk>
It's a <unk> group of people worried about a very detailed report <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's not about political activism is political activism -- political activism is <unk> <unk>
And for those of us <unk> ourselves to the government, is time that world do we want to do with leave our kids to leave with them.
You have to see the big challenges that they have to face.
Do you really think we're going to reach where we have to go to go without solving the institution the institution that we can act on behalf of <unk> name.
We can't even get away from government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that that is technology is that we with technology is that we with technology that is technology that is technology is that we with technology is that we with technology is that we with technology is to be able to rethink the root function in root root root root root root into root root root root root root root root root root root root root root
So there is a generation that we grew up with the Internet and knows not that hard to act <unk> you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average average age of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members of our members
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about, are all going to talk about.
You can can can make your views in any same time and same time and do it.
So when we face the government problem problem, government problem not much about to make hear their voices.
They are using your hands.
They send them back to the work to program applications better at the government.
And those applications allow us to use the use our hands in improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a fire fire <unk> out <unk> dumping a garbage garbage garbage <unk> <unk>
We were always able to be able to be able to get away with me <unk> and these many people do it.
But these applications are like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> not just be consumers, consumers, not just not only of us of government consumers that we are government <unk> -- of government <unk> of government <unk> and get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to going to fix the government until we did not <unk> <unk>
So I want to ask all all of us, you all -- you -- all all of us, you -- all all of us, you, when you about the important things that we need to do together, we all have to be a crowd of voices in voices, we will going to be a crowd of voices, a crowd of voices, will be going to be a crowd of voices,
Thank you.
This is for me a real real honor.
I've spent most majority of the time in the time in the time in the time in the time in the time in the time in the time in the time in the time in the time in the time in the time in the time in the time in the time in the time in the time in the time in the time in the time in the time
I've spent most much part of my life in my life <unk> <unk> and places where there is a lot despair.
And I'll be here at TED TED looking and watch and hear these <unk> <unk>
One of the things I ever noticed in this short time, TED is identity.
And the things that you say here is actually have impact on have impact around the world.
Sometimes you know, something comes from TED, TED is TED, it makes a sense and a force that I would not have a different way.
I say this is why I think identity is really important. <unk>
Here's what we've seen with fantastic <unk>
And I think we have learned that the words of a professor may a teacher can make much sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A physician can do good things like, <unk> -- can it achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of the identity.
I actually did not learn this in the practice of the rule of the right, my work.
I learned about my grandmother's <unk>
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family <unk> <unk> dominated by a <unk> <unk> <unk> my grandmother.
It was a tough one, it was strong, it was strong, had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> <unk> many other <unk> <unk> on our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves. out.
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk> <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> way that the world looks like.
She was a tough thing, but it was a <unk> <unk>
When I was a little bit short and looked at it, and was approaching me and was a good one.
I would just get it so hard that I could barely barely breathe, and breathe and then get away in.
One or two hours of hours later, he was going back back up to <unk> <unk> I was going back back up to <unk> <unk> I was going to <unk> -- still feel my <unk> up.
And if it was saying that, no, I went back back back, and tell you, yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that the would you always want to want to want to want to want to be close to it.
The only problem is that they had 10 children.
My mother was the <unk> <unk>
At any time I was going to spend a time with it, it was not easy to capture his time and capture his time.
My My cousins were running running around. out.
I remember when I was eight or nine or nine years, nine years, I was woke up in a morning, I went to the room, and there was all all all my cousins. out.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room room, and looked at <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at him and smile, and smile, it was very serious.
After 15 or 20 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went up in the room, and got to my hand, and said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I remember this as though was yesterday.
I will never forget.
He took me out out and said, "Let me <unk> you tell you, something, something, but you can't <unk>
I was like, <unk> <unk> <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Then I sat down down, me and looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been going to come on.
And <unk> "I think you're a <unk> <unk>
He said, "I think I think you can do what you like."
I will never forget.
And then she said, "Just I want you to get it for me for me for me about three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I wanted to <unk> you -- is that you want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> <unk> my <unk> and you have to <unk> <unk>
Like I went back up to my mom, my mom, I was like, "Yes, you -- "Yeah, let's go."
Then he said to me, is the second thing I wanted to talk about -- is me to me is that you are always going to do the right thing right now, even though is it?
I thought, and I said, "Yes, you want to do."
Then he finally said, "The third third thing I want to tell you -- is me to is that you have a <unk> <unk>
I was just nine years old, and I said, "Yes, I know what?
I grew up in the field, in rural <unk> I got a brother a brother a older year old and a sister a sister. <unk>
When I was 14 -- or 15, a day my brother came home home with a <unk> <unk> six <unk> I don't know where the <unk> did <unk> us have my sister <unk> and myself for the forest.
We just got to get the <unk> <unk> <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he was offered him to my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to take a little bit and offered me to take a little bit and volunteered for me.
I said, "No, no, no.
My brother said, <unk> you know about it, <unk> <unk> And you can do the same thing that we do.
I just took something, your sister -- too. I would a <unk> <unk>
I said, "No. I wasn't good. You can <unk>
And then my brother looked at me <unk> me at me <unk>
And he said, "What's wrong with you with you take a <unk> <unk>
And I went up up with a look up with force strength and <unk> "Oh, not be you not to be still thinking about the <unk> <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tell all all all the grandchildren that are <unk> <unk>
I was a <unk> <unk>
I have to admit that one thing for you.
I'll tell you something that I probably should not say.
I know this is spread <unk> <unk>
But I am I admit that I've never taken a little drop of an alcohol.
I don't say this is what to be a <unk> thinking that it's a <unk> <unk> I'm going to say about the power that the identity.
When we created the right right kind right thing, we say things to others that really do not make any sense.
We can't not get them to do things that they don't think to be able to do.
I think about my grandmother naturally believed that all all of their grandchildren grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had had been a prisoner been imprisoned during <unk>
My friends died out of diseases about the alcohol.
And these were the things that it is, according to the other way that as we had to do this is <unk>
Now, I'm going to try to talk about our criminal justice justice system justice system system of criminal justice justice system.
This is a country today very different today different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were all <unk> <unk> <unk>
There is there you today is there today is today is there today is there today is there today is there today is there today is there today is there today is there today is there today is there today is there today is there today is there today is there today is there today is there today is there today is there today is there today is there today
In America, we have the biggest rate of <unk> <unk>
We have have seven million people in parole.
And this is massive <unk> in my opinion, it has changed fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> so much for determined by determined for these facts.
One in three three black people about 18 to the age 18 and 30 years is in the age 18 and 30 years is in the age 18 and 30 years in the age 18 and 30 years is in the age 18 and 30 years in the age 18 and 30 years is in the age 18 and 30 years is in the age 18 and the 30 years
In urban <unk> city urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban urban cities, cities, urban urban cities, cities, Los urban cities, Los urban Baltimore Baltimore Baltimore, 50 percent of all the young people in the
Our system is not only distorted just distorted in front of race, race, it's also about it about poverty.
In this country country, we got a criminal country country -- is a lot better if you're rich and hurt that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> <unk> <unk> not <unk> what affect the results results.
And it seems to us have really feel very <unk> very much.
The policy is the fear and the anger is to believe that these are these problems we problems.
We are <unk> out.
It seems to me that I find an interesting <unk>
We're all looking at our work in some really good developments very curious.
In my state, in Alabama, well how do you like to do with other other state states, you for always if you have an criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male male male population is missing -- is definitely the right right to vote.
And if we put it in the next 10 years of the last 10 years of the rights loss of rights be as high as high as high as well that they <unk> the law of the right to the vote.
We got this amazing silence.
I represent children.
A lot lot of my customers are customers very young.
The United States is the only country country in the world where was sentence sentence sentence sentence sentence sentence sentence sentence sentence sentence sentence sentence for about prison.
We got to have this country country, prison for children -- have no chance to come out. out.
Now we're now in a process of some of them <unk> <unk>
The only country happened in the world.
They will people teach people in people in the death <unk> row.
This is matter about the death penalty matter of death is interesting.
In a certain sense of us have got to think that the ultimate question is, is the people deserve to die for the <unk> <unk>
Very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way we're in in our identity.
There's another other way of <unk> it is not about to decide whether people have to die for the <unk> <unk> <unk> but if we to the kill.
This is interesting.
The death sentence in America is mistake. <unk>
From every other nine nine nine <unk> <unk> <unk> have been identified with one that is innocent -- is <unk> and released from the death corridor <unk> out.
A <unk> of the error, you <unk> is an innocent a innocent one innocent one innocent one.
This is interesting.
In aviation you couldn't never fly out in fly up in airplanes if of every nine you would <unk> -- one one of <unk>
But somehow we sort of really get us from the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our own charge.
It's not our struggle.
I speak a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my students in my students <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was talking about about terrorism, the time that was at the end of the rebuilding of the reconstruction and took up to the Second Second World War.
We certainly don't know about much much about this.
But for American Americans in this country, it was a time defined by horror by terror.
In many people people were afraid to be <unk> yet.
He was worried about going to be <unk> for?
The threat of terror is terror is what defined his lives defined as defined about.
Now there are many people older people going to come up with me and me and tell me, today is it going to do it -- do you know about what in our face address for the first time with terrorism.
They ask me to say, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The age of terrorism was terrorism was, he was also about with segregation we about <unk> and decades of race, race and racial <unk> <unk>
In this country country country, we have a dynamic one where we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we had to do with all with each other.
We will constantly create and create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about progress, I think it's because we are not willing to engage involved with a process of truth and really hard to engage to engage with a process and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people realize that we could not overcome overcome the segregation we have to have segregation that truth and truth and truth and overcome it.
In Rwanda even before the genocide were in the genocide had this commitment, this commitment, we have been done before.
And I was a way I was going to come up at talk about death at death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stand after my presentation slide and said, "You know that it's good disturbing to you guys to hear about what do you <unk>
<unk> <unk> not have no death penalty death pity in Germany.
We will never be able to be able to do that.
The room was just silently and a lady said, "There's there's no way that we with our history, we could ever get to get away in in the systematic death systematic population of human beings.
It would be irrational that we be <unk> intentional and <unk> we put us to run it.
Let's get a lot about this.
How are we going to focus on in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people people, -- especially if they were going to come in.
We could not <unk> you <unk>
It would be irrational.
And even this is even like that, there is it there be this lifelong disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we actually don't care about these things that hard as hard -- hard -- difficult issues, the positive things and wonderful things and wonderful things so hard, the positive things and wonderful things and wonderful things that hard, the positive things and beautiful things and wonderful things that hard and really care about it.
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology that technology is <unk> <unk> <unk>
We love about entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> <unk> <unk> by the suffering, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In my mind, you need to integrate both both <unk> both both <unk>
Now, I'm also talking about the need to have more hope, more hope, more dedication to a dedication more dedication to the more dedication with the basic challenges of life lives in this complex world.
I think that means is going to mean spend more time thinking about and talk about the poor, the <unk> <unk> -- that you will never come to have TED.
Think about it is, in a way, something that is inside of our being.
It's true that we have to believe us believe what we have seen before.
So we are, despite all be as rational to be so rational as committed as rational as committed as rational as committed as rational as committed as rational as <unk> as committed as rational as committed as rational as committed as rational as committed as rational as committed as rational as committed as rational as committed as rational as committed as rational as committed as rational as committed as rational
And with innovation, it's creativity -- the development is going to come out only about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> also by the <unk> <unk>
This is this <unk> connection of mind with mind is heart is what drives us going to look at just not only have brilliant and <unk> it is just how bright and <unk> it is also about dark and <unk> in the dark way.
<unk> <unk> a great <unk> <unk> <unk>
He said, "When we were in East East Europe, Eastern Europe, suffering -- we wanted him all all sorts of things, but but mainly what we needed was to have was needed was to have was we needed was to have was we needed was to have was we needed was to have was we needed was to have was we needed was to have was we needed was to
Well, that kind of orientation for the spirit that I think, still in communities as TED TED, you <unk>
There is there any disconnect related to with technology technology and design, it allows us to be truly <unk> if we did not pay attention attention to you have care care about attention attention to you, care attention to poverty be care about is we paying attention attention to you have care care about attention attention to you, care attention to poverty be care about is we paying attention attention
Now I want to warn you guys is one that these thoughts are a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, a very young lawyer was going to meet Rosa <unk> out.
These women were together just to talk about.
Occasionally, I read the lady <unk> called me to me -- are the <unk> <unk> <unk> are going to get us to talk to.
Do you want to come and get it in.
I said, "Yes, I know a <unk> <unk>
So she was like, "Well what are you going to do when do you do when are you <unk>
I would a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So I was going to go and just take them in.
It was a very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. <unk> came to me and tell me that this is this idea of <unk> <unk>
Tell me what are you about to do."
And I started to give my address.
I said, "Well, we're just trying to question the injustice.
We try to help those people that have been <unk> <unk> <unk>
We tried to confront confront prejudice and confront issues and confront prejudice and instruction in management criminal justice.
We are trying to end the sentences sentences of life sentences for life, life, without freedom at the kids.
We tried to do something something about the death penalty thing about.
We tried to reduce the population in jail.
We are trying to stop the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech and close to the end end and end up at the end end and end up at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> very much.
At the moment, Mrs. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the face and said, "It's why is why you have to have to have to have you have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have
I believe in reality, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to address these challenges, these issues, problems, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity is finally also about compassion is compassion for each other.
I learned a few very simple things in my work.
I've been teaching in simple things.
I've come to understand how to believe that each other one of us is higher to the worst that we've <unk>
I think that's true for all true for everybody that everyone is on the world.
I'm convinced that if someone says is a lie, not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if you take something that you don't belong -- not -- be a <unk> one.
Even if someone kills each other one, it is not be a <unk> one.
So I think there's a basic dignity in people who have to be <unk> for the law.
I also think in many many many parts of this country country country country country -- and many many many different parts of the world, the opposite of the world -- the world, the opposite of the world is the world, the opposite is that the wealth.
It isn't.
I really think about really think that in many many different parts the opposite people are opposite in justice.
And finally, I can then finally, I think it's very much very much very beautiful, very beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we are not going to judge us for our technology for our technology, by our technology, because of our technology for our technology, for our design technology, by our design -- by our design -- by our design technology, by our design -- by our design -- by
At the end of the end, you get the character in a society, not the rich rich way to deal the rich rich, powerful, powerful people rich and <unk> but why are the poor people poor, <unk> <unk> them?
Because it's in this context of we started to understand really really understand really really understand really really understand really really understand really really understand really really understand really really understand really really understand really really understand really really understand really really understand really really understand really really understand really really understand really really understand really really understand really really understand really really understand really really understand really really understand
Sometimes I feel a <unk> <unk> I'm going to just end with a story.
Sometimes I do a lot to force much.
<unk> tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas are going beyond in a very important way.
I've been representing these kids that one to have a lot very much <unk> <unk>
I'm going to jail and see my <unk> in 13 and 14 and 14 years, that have been <unk> for you for them to have adults as adults.
And I'm starting to think, how can it be?
How can a judge is a judge turn someone in turn someone in what it isn't it?
The judge is <unk> <unk> as an adult, <unk> <unk>
And I was a very late time I was late was going to <unk> <unk> <unk> God, if the judge can be able to turn it into something that you don't -- are you not -- -- have to have have to have have to have have to have the magic powers.
Yeah, they <unk> the judge have a magical powers.
You should want to ask for something about that.
As it was a very late, he couldn't not think correctly, right, right, right, but began to work it right.
He had a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> black black.
I started to work on in the <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for me that my <unk> <unk> <unk> was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> I put up there have been there have been an <unk> behavioral <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
There was there a <unk> line up over how this country is country -- there is no country country no country -- there is no country no ethical way, but whole whole whole lack of good thing.
The next morning, I first woke up in the morning the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> would be a dream a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only have only only have it <unk> it was <unk> it -- but had to the court.
About a couple of two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally I <unk> my God, God, I have to go to the court for this case stupid.
I got up to the car, and I was feeling about <unk> <unk>
I went into the car in court.
I thought this would be really be very hard to and get it on.
And I finally finally got down out of the car off the car, you went to court.
He was going up up the stairs when the stairs when I found myself with a black man <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
When I got to see me and said, "Who is you <unk>
I said, "I'm a <unk> he <unk> <unk> "That's you <unk> <unk>
So I would then go on me and <unk> me. me."
And I was just going on in ear, you.
He said, "I'm proud to be proud to <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
And that was deeply deeply <unk> with my own inner identity with the ability that we all have to contribute the community to the community with a hope.
Well, I walked up into the audiences.
When I walked in, the judge saw me in.
And he was like, "Mr. Stevenson, you -- you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I was a <unk> <unk> <unk>
People began to get there. out.
I was the one that I was writing about <unk> <unk>
They got the cops policemen the prosecutors <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, I wasn't able to know how, the room was full of people because we talking about races, because we're talking about races, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> <unk> I went to look at the <unk> that I was going to go on.
I would just look out the way out the window and <unk> <unk> hear all that whole <unk>
You <unk> for here and come up there.
Finally, this old old black man <unk> <unk> <unk> face of worry, he walked up in the room room room, and sat down in the front of me at the <unk> table.
About 10 minutes later, the <unk> judge was <unk> <unk>
During the <unk> one <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The New <unk> <unk> <unk>
He said, <unk> what do you do in the room <unk>
And the old black stood up up, he looked at the <unk> <unk> I looked at the <unk> and he said, <unk> this little young man to keep her view at the goal for <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think that many many many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but but it spreads into justice.
We cannot not be truly <unk> if we were going to do is whether we're really concerned about human rights and for dignity.
That is our survival linked to the other things.
That our technology of technology, technology, design, design and creativity is <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>
And above those of all of all, people here to share this, this, just want to tell you that you keep just keeping sight on in the goal for <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: From people to hear -- hear and see a particular desire in the audience audience audience audience in the audience -- audience in the audience in the audience -- audience in the audience in the audience -- audience in the audience in the audience -- audience in the audience in the audience in the audience in the audience in the audience in the audience in the audience --
Something that's not a <unk> <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are many many different opportunities close opportunities up.
If you live in the state of California, for example, you have to have this be <unk> <unk> this is going to do a <unk> effort for <unk> the money that we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> the funds that are you now spent now are spending right now in political <unk>
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row of death, over the next five years, billion billion dollars.
And despite this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> don't come in.
Here is a chance of change.
This is a little <unk> it's going to come to propose that is <unk> -- these funds are the funding that the law enforcement <unk>
I think there is a very close opportunity to go very close in.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the last three decades.
Part of the most part, of the explanation, it tells you have to have to do with the biggest <unk> rate of <unk>
What would you say you to say you to say that you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has remained relatively stable.
The great big growth in massive <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's because of the bad war against drugs.
That's why is that that is dramatic increase rise in the dramatic rise dramatic increase rise in the dramatic rise rise rise in dramatic increase in dramatic increase rise in in the <unk>
And we let us have to convince us to convince the rhetoric rhetoric rhetoric is.
We have to have three legal causes to bring people in to <unk> <unk> <unk> small crimes against the property, rather than we bring these resources resources to their victims.
I think we have to have to have to make more to help the victims of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It seems to me that our current current study about punishment is not doing anything for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> Have you <unk> you really talk about today today are you about today about today about today are you about today about today about today about today about today are you about going to be talking about today about today about today are you about today about today about today about today are you about talking about today.
You're very inspiring.

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of some of the pictures of the clips of the clips that I got over in the last six months of <unk> <unk> could be the last six days or the last six few days.
The idea is that media means <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> news, because our minds are paying attention to you.
And that's what answers to a very good reason.
In every second one day -- our senses is getting many many more data data out probably the brain probably the brain probably <unk> ...
And as nothing is more important to us more than survive, survive, the first data is all about is an old clip of the temporal lobe being called <unk> <unk>
The amygdala is our early early early early early early early early early early early early early early warning detector, that the <unk> <unk> detector.
<unk> and records all the whole piece of information for something about the environment that I could is to make us harm.
So that's why is one <unk> <unk> of stories of us to look at the negative.
That old <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is very true.
And because all of the digital devices have the digital devices have the digital devices have the seven days of the week, 24 days of a week, 24 hours a week, is not surprising that we be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is wrong bad.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe, instead of what really happens is we get <unk> <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress was done in the last century, for a number of forces are <unk> <unk> in such a way that we have the potential to to create an abundance world in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we are not saying that we are not saying that we are not saying that we are not saying that we are not saying that we are not saying that we are not saying that we are not saying that we are not saying that we are not saying that we are not saying that we are not saying that we are not saying that we
As human beings are human beings, are humans very good at <unk> the problems -- and all the long long as long as we used to.
Let's look at the last century century to see where we go.
In the last hundred hundred years, a hundred hundred years, a hundred hundred years, a hundred hundred years, a hundred hundred years, a hundred hundred years, a hundred hundred years, a hundred hundred years, a hundred hundred years, a hundred hundred years, a hundred hundred years, a hundred hundred years, a hundred hundred years, a hundred hundred years, a hundred hundred years, a hundred hundred years, a hundred hundred years,
The child mortality has been reduced reduced 10 times.
Furthermore, the cost cost of food food -- food -- is food to food -- of food food, electricity -- of transportation and communications, it's fallen off 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker <unk> us have me showed us that we are living in the most peaceful time of human history history.
And Charles expanse the global literacy happened 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're actually living in an extraordinary time.
A lot of people were looking at it.
And we still continue to find out -- have to get out to have it and forth -- have to get out to do with it -- and get up to <unk> expectations and <unk>
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.

The <unk> <unk> <unk> of the last century, <unk> <unk> on the planet, I would ever have dreamed <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was a lot about this is the technology that is technology -- and <unk> its exponential exponential up.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any possible tool that we <unk> in the information information is jumps on in the information information is jumps on in this curve, Moore's Law, sort of Moore's Law, and double the price of price in the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So that's why your mobile phone is in in your pocket is a million times cheaper -- and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer supercomputer 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing it is -- -- in good and bad ones, and bad ones, in war and and in the recession, in the recession is that that is very soft that is a soft thing that's going to -- right and bad and bad enough and bad ones, and bad enough and bad enough and bad ones, and bad enough and bad ones, and bad enough and bad
This is the amount of fast fast computers fast computers that we used to do that we can make computers <unk>
It's not stopping stop any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, the curve goes up. up.
The growth rate of technology is growth is actually faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> it from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell ourselves.
<unk> in the cloud, my friends in <unk> are <unk> <unk> infinite computation and infinite computing, sensors that 3D printing and their <unk> ability to democratize are vaccines in 3D printing up in the entire planet, synthetic <unk> and their ability to democratize is that this 3D printing and their ability to be 3D printing 3D printing 3D data 3D printing over the planet, the planet, synthetic ability to democratize
I mean, how many saw you guys see saw see what was in "Jeopardy" <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> spade.
I was looking at the best headline than I was doing. for.
And I loved this: this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a very easy game.
<unk> <unk> from the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, in the cloud, available for all all the cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Ray Kurzweil and me, launch a new university called <unk> <unk> <unk>
We taught these technologies for our students, very few students can can be used to solve the great challenges of great challenges of great challenges of great challenges.
And every year we were asked to release release one company, or a product that can be able to affect the bad lives in a decade. decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can have a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion students today can impact for a billion students today.
Thirty <unk> years ago, that would have <unk> <unk> <unk>
Today we can point up to point to a <unk> companies in companies that already done before.
When I think about creating abundance, how to make life life <unk> for each other <unk> <unk> <unk> it is creating a life life.
It's about taking that is going to take that is all about going to take this <unk>
You can see, is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
He is the kind of the kind of the left.
<unk> <unk> the king <unk>

But the king <unk> ate <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the <unk> most valuable metal of the planet, <unk> <unk> was worth more than gold and <unk>
So that's why the tip <unk> end is <unk> to the Washington Washington <unk>
You see, you already see, the aluminum is the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the mass of the Earth does you see, you now see, is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's tied on by the oxygen and <unk>
But then he <unk> the <unk> something so cheap that we use it as if we were <unk> out.
We will just take this analogy for the future.
Let's think about think about the energy <unk> <unk> <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on on a planet we were going to are on on one planet -- is going to be on a planet -- have four with more times more energy than we used in one year.
They come up to the Earth 16 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It isn't not about they <unk> it is about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in solar energy in India is the 50 percent less than one <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> rupees against 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy over solar is solar power has solar has solar energy over fell up to the last year last year.
Last month, we last month, the last month, this is a study study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the United States, the U.S. <unk> <unk> in the United States, the U.S. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it will cost the solar power six cents a <unk> hour compared to compared to the 15 time with national average.
And if we have abundance of energy abundance we also have abundance of the water.
Let's talk now about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl wrote the Voyager spacecraft Voyager hits the Earth, in 1990, after I was <unk> on.

Yes, the <unk> is fresh water. saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> the water <unk> of the water <unk> the planet, but there's a hope here.
It's a technology that is available in 10 or 10 years, 20 years, but right now.
It comes to its <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a conversation about a conversation with presentation Kamen Kamen in the <unk> I would like to share with you with you, you guys to <unk> his technology <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It is able to bring it to generate a lead 1,000 a thousand full water <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> water <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> less than two cents the gallon.
The president of the president of Coke thought is going to make a significant test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, well, and I have full confidence that it is a place in <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> innovation <unk> through this technology that is today exists.
And we've just seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to reach the way to 70 percent of the mobile phones in the mobile phones in the end of the end of 2013.

Maybe the best work is going to get up when a number of applications in the time.
Last month, I was the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called <unk> X <unk> X <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world teams of the world to <unk> -- have these technologies in a mobile device -- mobile device -- mobile device -- mobile -- that is, you can can <unk> you can get blood from the <unk>
In order to win it is that you have to make better work <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Imagine this <unk> device in the developing world in the developing world that there are no medical doctors, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> about 25 -- and there are health workers.
When this <unk> device is <unk> a virus RNA or <unk> not going to call the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> very first time to stop that that we was pandemic.
But that's this one is the biggest force to produce a famine world.
I call it the <unk> <unk>
The white lines here is the population.
We just got to pass the mark out of the seven billion. billion.
By the way, the best protection is best protection in the population explosion of the population explosion is to to the world world world world.
In 2010, we were just less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we're going to go back from two billion to five <unk> five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion of minds have before <unk> be <unk> on add up into the global conversation.
What do these people want to do these people? want to do?
What do you do? <unk> <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse -- is going to have the biggest economic injection of the story.
These people are tens of the tens of billions of dollars <unk> <unk> in the global economy.
And thank you of more health care about the way of a better education of the better education of the better education with the <unk> <unk> Academy and because of the use 3D impressions use it in the cloud of the cloud of the cloud are going to be more productive than ever before. before.

How about a voices never <unk> before.
What about if we give them to the assumptions that they are, a voice to be <unk> -- and be able to act for the first time?
What do you mean to do about it? -- are these three billion?
And if you are contributions that we can not <unk> <unk>
Something that I learned with the X X X <unk> is that we have started with the X X <unk> is that that was small, led by his passion to a point, of you of of course you do things things to do things you guys all about <unk> things that before they could only do the great corporations and governments.
I'm going to just share with sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program program program that maybe some some of you have heard of.
It's called <unk> <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a <unk> sequence of amino amino acids to figure out the way that the protein is going to be fold in.
<unk> determine the structure and <unk> <unk>
It's a very important thing about medical research research.
And until now, it was a <unk> problem.
They've played with these teachers teachers college teachers at each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined together and began to <unk> it.
And it's been shown that today is this today is the current model of human patterns of the human patterns is better <unk> <unk> proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me an enormous trust in the future is that we have more power people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We got the passion for the <unk> <unk>
We got the capital of <unk> <unk>
And we have now have three million new minds that we were focused on, to work on the solution of great challenges we had big challenges in big challenges and have big challenges in big challenges and do what we should need to do.
We got in front of a few decades of us.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can the idea can be be explained in a minute, before you give them three examples for the time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, about <unk>
You probably believe a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were actually <unk> fish.
And he described one as very <unk> <unk>
It was the <unk> <unk>
He was a lot to the <unk> <unk>
Now the fish is on the Red <unk> <unk>
But we've heard this story many many times of times, about the Galapagos and other places, these other places -- so that has nothing special about special.
But the case is that we still come up to the Galapagos.
We are still thinking about <unk>
<unk> still tell me <unk>
So what happens about here?
The second story story, also also mean another one other concept. <unk> shift on the waist.
Because I was here in <unk> <unk> studying one <unk>
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk> <unk>
I was so burned up very much with the sun, and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first show to the sun.
The <unk> was surrounded by <unk> <unk> <unk>
There was there that one about 20 centimeter on 20 centimeter a black <unk> <unk>
And fishing about this <unk> <unk> it was very abundant and moved up for a good time, a good time ago, so was it <unk> more than half a half half a half half about average.
When I went out there 27 years later, the amount of fish had been dropped down in half.
I went back up to the five inches tall.
It will one <unk> a genetic pressure pressure.
There were even fish.
In a way, they were still even happy.
And the fish were still just going to be there.
But anyway, nothing is changed, changed, but all of us have changed.
My third third story is that I was <unk> <unk> <unk> in the introduction of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing fishing development was supposed to impose up to the countries who already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this boat, pretty bad -- this is <unk> <unk> <unk>
I went out to fish in it, in the <unk> South East Sea <unk> <unk> and above the middle of the <unk>
What we did capture capture was <unk> <unk>
<unk> now you know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety other <unk> <unk>
And most of the fish are fish are <unk> <unk> little about <unk> remains <unk> <unk> <unk>
In short, the sea of the sea came up to cover it, and then went on.
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year a year, you do a study study -- and then start the commercial fishing together.
The bottom is going to be a solid bottom is a solid bottom of the soft coral of the soft coral from being a soft coral from being a solid coral of the soft coral from being a soft coral from being a solid coral of the soft coral from being a soft coral from being a solid coral of the soft coral from being a soft coral from being
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
Once we were once capture a alive.
I was still not <unk> <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> it because it was a good food.
This is mountain a mountain <unk> mountain of remains is what the fishermen are collected about, they collect the fishermen every time you go to an area where they have never been made.
But it's not <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were going to look at the world, but do we remember it.
<unk> the point of start start -- the start start -- the start start -- the start start -- the start start -- the start start -- the start start -- the start start -- the start start -- the start start -- the start start -- the start start -- the start start -- the start start -- the start start -- the start start -- the start start
So if you <unk> this is something like this.
On the <unk> and we have a lot to <unk> things <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> water.
And that changes all the time with time, it changes because people do about <unk>
Every generation we can use the images that the beginning of their conscious lives as normal and the <unk>
The difference is that they perceive loss loss.
But they don't just perceive the loss that thing that happened before.
You can look at the accumulation <unk> of change.
And I was at the end you have a few <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that's what we want to do now.
We want to keep keep out there that they are no longer that they are or not they -- are not about -- are not what they gone.
But one should we think that this problem affects people when societies come in, kill animals without knowing what they had to have a few generations later.
Because of course, an animal is a very plentiful, very abundant plentiful, it <unk> is <unk> <unk>
You doesn't lose <unk> animals.
You loses a little little lost <unk> <unk>
Even if this is not perceived as much as much as great as a great loss.
Over the time, we focused on in large animals and big and large animals in the big animals, and -- in a sea synonymous with great fish.
They get a little little bit bit bit frequent <unk>
Over time, there are a few little fish -- but just thinking that that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, a lot of many people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do because evidence that evidence is presented in a previous previous way that they would expect you to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some people have to do, as a as captain as Captain just looked at a lot many fish in this area can't be used -- or, usually you usually do the scientists use of the fish in the <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know about the past, even though we lived in <unk> <unk> societies -- don't trust us in the sources of the sources of the past.
So there is the enormous role that you can actually be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Because with the protected areas, marine areas protected protected in, we really <unk> <unk>
It will <unk> the past people that people can't think conceive about, because the point of play is starting to play a time has run in, and is extremely extremely extremely extremely <unk>
That's for the people that you see is a protected area protected area protected <unk> they can benefit from the vision that we can <unk> -- which is them to erase their point of <unk> point.
And what happens to the people that you can't do do it because they have no access, like the people in the West <unk> <unk> <unk> people are in the West <unk>
I think that the arts and the cinema is -- can just fill in empty empty gap. The simulation.
This is a simulation <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
A long time had had gray whales have gray whales gray whales were in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And you might have noticed that the <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you think about <unk> <unk> if you think about why people were really excited about <unk> <unk> <unk> talk about the story of <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because it was something that in a certain sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to <unk> is <unk> -- is <unk> <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. It's Kevin <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's true.
So today, we will now see what are you going to see why do you see why do you see why are the viral videos make the viral <unk> and do the importance to do that.
We all want to be <unk> -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger -- that it was a very difficult thing.
But today the web video is that one of us, or or our actions, it <unk> <unk> in a part of our world culture.
Anyone can actually be done in the Internet famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They climb up more than 48 hours of video video to a minute. up.
And of those of them just a small percentage of the percentage of the <unk> have a myriad myriad <unk> <unk> <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of community trends, communities of participation in communities of the communities communities of these people in surprise.
Well, let's <unk>
<unk> Oh, oh my God, my God. God.
Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: The last year year, <unk> <unk> <unk> published published this video shot outside his house in National Park National Park.
In 2010, I was just seen about 23 million times.
This is a graph chart on the <unk> back into the popularity of the popular last summer summer.
He <unk> not <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just wanted to share that share is just share with share is share with just share with share is share with just share is share with share is share with just share is share with share with you share with you share a double double rainbow. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's what one does is you do if it's called <unk> <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already published many many many videos of nature of nature.
This video was had been published in January.
So what happened to happen here?
He was just Jimmy <unk> <unk>
Jimmy <unk> <unk> published this dream to the video <unk>
The <unk> trends like like Jimmy <unk> <unk> us have new and interesting things and exciting -- to a larger audience.
Rebecca <unk> <unk>  Is it's Friday, I just have this conversation without talk about this video, <unk>
A book A book is <unk> from Rebecca <unk> Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it nearly 200 million times this year.
This graph is this chart shows the frequency of use the use of use.
And just like <unk> <unk> <unk> this video appeared out to be coming out of the time.
So what did happened this one country happened.
Well, it was an Friday, it's true.
And if you ask the other <unk> <unk> are also a Friday.
But what happened to happen this country this day, this particular <unk>
Well, he took <unk> <unk> and many many people started writing about it.
Michael <unk> <unk> <unk> Science <unk> Science <unk> <unk> was one of the first people in making a joke about video on Twitter.
But what's important one thing is that one is a one that one is important is that one person or a bunch of creators creators <unk> will take a view of view and can share it with a broader audience and get it with a broader audience. <unk>
So, this is a community of people who shares this great <unk> <unk> <unk> then start talking about that and do things.
And now you have to have now have these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, seven days, there was a number for every other other few other other days.
Unlike the <unk> level of the 20th <unk> of the 20th century, this community involvement is our way to be part of the kind of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's this, that's all about this is that is all this is all about.
This year -- is about 50 million times of times.
And if you think that is rare, weird to know that there's a three hours of three times of times.
Until the cats have to see this video.
And there are you guys to saw other cats looking at the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that I woke out between the other Internet Internet community <unk>
There was <unk> <unk>
Somebody made a version of the old old one.
And then he was international <unk>
Suddenly, I got a whole whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a stupid joke about something we all can can all be part about.
Because today not only be only <unk> <unk>
Who could might be something that might be something about this?
Who could might have have predicted be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or Black Rebecca <unk> <unk>
What a script script might script script script wrong with script script wrong with script to do -- this is <unk>
In a world where two is two two days of video days of video a video clip a minute, just a minute, just just be able to figure out the way that these things have done about.
When a friend told me to me that I have to see this great video from a kind that protest against <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> but are there so much of obstacles that you armed with eating them properly out.
KA: Thank you at the surprise -- very surprise to the surprise and head of their humor, <unk> <unk> five million you could see and understand the idea.
So that's why this is really approach for all everything new we do in a creative way.
And all this is really lead us to a great question of this.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean? mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean? mean?
The creators are linked makers creative communities to participation, creative -- are features of a new kind of new type of media -- of a new kind of new types of media -- of a new culture, where we all have access to have access and is the way for the <unk>
As well as I say earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin of the world, Justin around the world, Justin <unk> in the world, Justin <unk> around the world in the world, Justin -- in the world, Justin <unk> around it, Justin <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
They won't <unk> permission to express their ideas.
We are all all kind of a little <unk> <unk>
These are not the characteristics of the old media characteristics of the old media, <unk> are just going to be present now, but encourage the other entertainment in the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story. <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk> <unk>
So let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning for a whole lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a <unk> a man <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the single hopes of unit and freedom <unk>
<unk> while <unk> come into in the <unk> <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had had been totally been totally been totally been totally been totally been totally been totally been totally in vain. either.
The words for a long time, my <unk> <unk>
You <unk> in silence.
He died broken up in a story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more much more than our memories.
My grandmother was never allowed me to forget his story. story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was tried to <unk> <unk> <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat boat <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
My <unk> <unk> was just just 18 years of when her father died, and was a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For her, life was meant to a <unk> <unk> <unk> escape her family and new life in Australia.
It was a <unk> <unk> <unk> for her that it can't do this.
And after a <unk> <unk> <unk> challenges the fiction, a boat <unk> <unk> <unk> to the sea dressed in a <unk> ship.
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the employees, they fear and death.
As the majority of the adults of adults, my mother had a <unk> <unk> <unk>
If we would first first -- first we would we first we take my sister me, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories in my first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of motor, engine, the engine, <unk> <unk> <unk> in each wave, and the vast horizon.
I don't remember the <unk> that they came several times, but got the men in the men in our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But I know what the lights of the lights of the <unk> lights in the front page of the Malaysia, Malaysia, Malaysia, Malaysia, Malaysia, A young man that collapsed -- and died, just finish the journey that journey was too much for it. <unk> <unk> <unk> journey was too much to do it, and finish the journey that journey was too much for it. <unk> <unk> journey was too to
No apple had no apple <unk> <unk> <unk> same flavor.
After three months in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is puzzle -- is about four women in the three generations giving a way a new life together.
We set up in <unk> <unk> a particular class <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the population is <unk> <unk>
Unlike the middle <unk> <unk> I was going to <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The smells were going out of the stores were out of the stores were in the rest of the world.
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> people among people people who had one thing in in common: they were all new. again.
My mother worked in tears after on a small <unk> <unk> of cars, working six days as much <unk> turn.
Yet, I found out time to study is studying English English and get a title for the <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars they were <unk> -- and established an extra <unk> <unk> <unk> not mind what it was supposed to be <unk> -- and was usually <unk> <unk> <unk>
Two hundred thousand <unk> <unk> for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform up to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So I go home, where do we are.
Something in me <unk>
I was a <unk> <unk> determination and determination and a voice <unk> <unk> <unk>
My mother, my sister and <unk> <unk> <unk>
My mother was <unk> <unk> every night, but got us on about our day and <unk> <unk> on our day and <unk> <unk> the movements in our grandmother in it.
My mother had <unk> <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be wakes up, wake up, until his nightmares were going to come on for <unk>
She opened a computer shop, then I studied for <unk> <unk> <unk>
And women would come up with their stories about men about men who couldn't not do with <unk> angry and angry and angry and <unk> <unk>
They were all about subsidies and <unk> it.
and they were created.
I lived on in the lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the <unk> classical <unk> <unk> <unk> classical <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> classical <unk> <unk> classical <unk> <unk> <unk> classical <unk> <unk> <unk> classical <unk> <unk> <unk> classical <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> classical <unk> <unk> <unk> classical <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> classical <unk> <unk> <unk> classical <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> classical <unk> <unk> <unk> classical <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> classical <unk> <unk> <unk> classical <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the other other <unk> I was <unk> in <unk> lives <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of many people were getting aid aid.
And for that work, I was studying my last year since I was studying my last year after I was studying my last year after I was studying my last year after I was studying my last year after I was studying my last year after I was studying my last year after I was studying my last year after I was studying my last year after I was studying
And I was a <unk> one piece of the puzzle to other other, the other thing, but its <unk> edges very much.
<unk> <unk> anonymously from <unk> <unk> was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> refugee and social activist <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> refugee -- and social activist <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a social activist <unk> <unk> a <unk> refugee -- and social activist <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> refugee -- and social activist <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> refugee -- and a social activist invited to talk
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about that.
I wanted to retreat the <unk> and comfort in life life in a particular <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a grandmother, a <unk> a mother and only ending the day as for nearly 20 years, <unk> <unk> on the day one day they did for almost 20 years of the day of a day of a day 20 and <unk> <unk> <unk> on the day from almost 20
And I said to my mom my mom who couldn't not do it.
It reminded me that I had right now the same age that she had when we get into the ship.
It was never been a choice.
<unk> He said, "and don't you not be <unk> for?
So I talked about what was talking about <unk> <unk> and youth and <unk> the marginalized and <unk>
And the more frankly talk, were talking about, -- more about it to talk about.
I met people from all all the paths of the paths of life, life, many of them doing what we were going to come in, living on the edge of as possible.
And although I finished my face, I realized that I could not to stay in in a person race.
So there was another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that is good to be an <unk> to be a kind of going to be an <unk> to be an <unk> a little bit new on the scene -- -- and not only be good at, but is something that is going to be grateful, -- maybe a gift of the ship.
Because it's going to be inside can be easily <unk> <unk> <unk> can mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk> <unk>
And I gave the enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world would <unk> <unk> but way we fear about.
<unk> that was not <unk> <unk> <unk>
There was there a energy there, a <unk> a rare mix rare humility and courage.
So I followed my intuition.
<unk> a little <unk> group of people who <unk> slogan <unk> <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For one year we was a <unk> <unk>
At the end of each day every day, I was doing a giant <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were going to get it up even good at night.
Most of our ideas were <unk> <unk> but some brilliant <unk> we opened our walk.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After one one just a single journey.
My challenge again.
Three months later, I had <unk> <unk> me and <unk> <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about this is about my grandmother. on my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> <unk> was <unk> -- was the <unk> social norm and the <unk> was the local <unk> <unk> <unk>
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up by <unk> alone.
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Without support of her husband, caused a <unk> the <unk> and bringing the cause her cause she itself, and much more <unk> when I won. won.
It can't not make it mean be wrong.
I was just in the shower in the room in a hotel room in a hotel <unk> <unk> when she died, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I looked at the way through the <unk> <unk> of the shower and saw it on the other side.
I knew I had to know what had <unk> <unk>
My mother called called a minutes later. later.
Days later, we went to a <unk> Buddhist temple in <unk> <unk> and sat down around the <unk>
We tell stories stories stories, we were still with it.
At the night, a <unk> <unk> came up and told us that I have to have to close up the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> <unk>
And I asked the <unk> <unk> why is his hand hand is hot, hot, warm hot, they <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> <unk> he said.
<unk> <unk>
If there's a nerve nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Because of the people who we were and how we could now now is that the men that have had come to our lives in our own lives would we have been <unk> out.
<unk> would have easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own children, kids, I ask about the ship.
Who could might want to want to want that to do that.
However, I was afraid about the very easy thing to the right point.
Can I give you a <unk> <unk> in their lives, they brave about every wave, the constant rate of the motor motor, the motor engine, is engine, -- the nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could just give it and look at it and watch it to a place, it would do it.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and also also be the right here today, in the fourth <unk> <unk>
My story begins in <unk> <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, in the desert <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were a conversation about a conversation about how is nothing about has changed since the age of the former former former old Indian <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In those days the Indians wanted to travel <unk> <unk> one car in a car <unk>
Now we do with an airplane airplanes.
At the time, when we were <unk> the great prince of the great prince holy Prince Indian warrior warrior <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the ground, you got water.
We now do is the same with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The bottom line we took was that that was replaced is the machinery have replaced the magic.
And that's me going to get a lot very much.
Every time I was feeling a little bit more about <unk>
I was going to tell this idea to lose the ability to enjoy and see and appreciate a sunset if I didn't get it to my friends.
It seemed to me that the technology I had to have the magic, do you not kill her.
As I had a girl my grandfather giving me his <unk> silver silver daily fat fat silver drive.
And this is a piece piece of that is 50 about 50 years was for my most magical thing.
It was a <unk> door to a world full of images of <unk> images, of hackers, and <unk> <unk> in my imagination.
I had the sense that the sense of sense that the mobile -- the mobile phone, the mobile phone, the <unk> you could <unk>
We were to love our inspiration.
So I was <unk> <unk> me the way to this technology world to see how to use it to create a magic magic, instead kill it.
<unk> books from the age of 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw the iPad, I saw a device <unk> capable of connected to the entire world.
You can know how we take the book, book.
Where we are.
And I can just gather the text up with the image image, the image, sound and animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling is getting more <unk> out.
But what do you mean for us do that?
I'm about to launch a <unk> interactive app for iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on the light."
And ...  he says, "This box is <unk> <unk> I write my name.
And I got a character back into the book.
In many times I got a <unk> <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live -- thanks to the GPS -- because of the GPS is going going to run through me.
My interior <unk> are excited about with all of all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I'm not talking to magicians and <unk> and <unk> that magic magic to childhood -- to those ideas that we have children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar would always be <unk> out.
So here we have to have it <unk> the iPad out, to release the fireflies.
And actually, it light your way your way up your way up in the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a girl was a little girl in a little girl on a <unk> <unk>
So here, every book here, every book and every world, it becomes a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> device inside the way.
And this is just open up a map.
So in all of you have have been there have been there have been maps, but have static maps of static maps.
This is a map that is <unk> <unk> <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book in the book in the book in the book the book in the book in the book in the book <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another extremely important thing that's important important for me is to do is create Indian content on Indian content in the contemporary time.
These are <unk> <unk>
We all all have heard of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but how many people were outside about India -- know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we're all bringing them back into a <unk> child <unk> <unk>
It's in a story that is currently about today about right now today today is current issues as the way of the current issues as environmental <unk>
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years of the last 10 years of the last 10 years has been <unk> attached to their <unk> <unk> <unk>
But now with mobile technology technology, we can get our children into the natural world with the technology.
One of the interactions of the book in the book in the book the book is that you have to go out outside the outside -- take the camera camera outside -- take a camera camera off, and take the camera out outside -- take the camera off, or take a camera camera off, and take the camera out outside -- take a camera camera off, and take the camera
As I was a little girl to <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For some reason children are already not doing. anymore.
So to how to bring this up of the childhood ritual time -- go out there, and go back up and forth -- in a sudden you have a picture of a picture of a flower -- and then get it <unk> <unk>
In other <unk> you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So this is a way a whole digital collection of photos that you can then can put on on the Web.
A <unk> boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> <unk> and he says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A <unk> Indian boy in India says, "I saw a <unk> <unk>
And you created this kind of a social network around a collection of digital pictures of digital pictures that have been taking. in.
Within the variants of the connection of connection connection between magic, the Earth and technology, there is many many possibilities.
In the next next book we had to have an an interaction that one comes out with the iPad and the video on and through augmented an augmented an augmented reality group <unk> <unk> on all the inner plants.
At the time the screen is <unk> full of the leaves in time.
And you have to have the sound of the wind of the wind of the wind of the wind of the wind and try you to be able to read the rest of the book.
We are going to a world a world where force of nature is going to spread through with technology technology and magic -- and technology to the way one to the other.
It will just take the power of the sun.
We are approaching our kids and close to the world the natural world to the natural world and all the way to the natural world, and the world to the natural world, and all of that magic, joy and love you that through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to tell you about why many many many different <unk> projects.
And I really think the most important thing about is that is that we just heard of listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the early University <unk> <unk> <unk> a director of the listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she said, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea -- and family -- family and <unk> it?
"How can we <unk> <unk>
And we tend to tend to think this is one one of the biggest problems that all of all, or maybe not all, -- but most majority of those <unk> <unk> are sick, listening.
This is my own Wi-Fi scale scale on very simple.
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Every morning I got to get myself in.
And yes, I got a challenge as challenging you see.
I got the challenge to get to the <unk> <unk>
But it's a simple simple one, that every time I was excited about, you <unk> my information for Google <unk>
And my doctor <unk> has access to him as well as well as my problem of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of
But there's another thing.
Like a few of you know, -- have more than four people followers on Twitter.
So every morning I will I connect my own Wi-Fi scale scale bread, and climb up into my car, the people are starting to <unk> <unk> <unk> I think you need you need you need you need to need you need you need to need you need you need to need you need you need to need you need you need to need you need you need to need you
That's the best thing that it can can happen, is happen to happen -- is that it's pressure of the base pairs used to help patients patients, because it could be used for the obesity, and for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, you can <unk> to move away to move people out their chairs and together to develop some <unk> <unk> <unk>
And from last week of the last week, next week last week.
This little little <unk> connected to an iPhone is connected connected to an iPhone is connected connected to an iPhone or connected up. out.
And people were going to go through from their houses, take your blood pressure, to your doctor, and share it with other others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position is where patients assume a position, get back up to control and regain the control together and regain the control together and regain the control together and regain the control together and regain the control together and regain the control together and regain the control together and regain the control together and regain the control together and reclaim the control control
And that's the techniques that we're very simple to use and start with this to engage the patients in the team.
And you can do with it with techniques like this, but just through <unk> <unk>
And one of the things that we did wanted to share it you with you with you with this with you with a video video.
We all have all have controls for navigation controls <unk>
Maybe we even have access them on in our cell phone.
We know a lot perfectly where is the smart <unk> do?
Where are all the <unk> are.
And of course, we can find a lot of fast food.
But where is the <unk> closest -- close to help this first patient?
We asked out here, but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where do you get to get the <unk> it saves life right now.
So what we did was to do was we do is <unk> <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to <unk> <unk> you look at a <unk> please <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you know, when are you open, open open, you know, sometimes open up into <unk> <unk>
And over the 10,000 <unk> were now introduced in the Netherlands. in the Netherlands.
The next step the next thing is to look for the search for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> <unk> reality <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city <unk> city of <unk> <unk> <unk> can use your iPhone, your iPhone, you can use your iPhone, your iPhone, and the next weeks to use his cell <unk> <unk> more close to find the <unk> more close to find the <unk> more close to find the <unk> more close to find the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And from today, I want to introduce you to introduce this is not just like <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that is the name of the product, but as <unk>
And we want to go on to the world level.
We are all <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in the world, other universities, to help us find out, work and work as a center for the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Every day there are on holiday and vacation and <unk> someone <unk> -- can be a kind of a relative one or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
And I also want to invite companies in companies around the world that could be able to make a look at <unk>
It could be a <unk> form of text services, <unk> or look at if the <unk> <unk> are just shown is still in place.
Please Let's focus on in this and not only do be better improve health, health, health, is we going to go on in this and not just improve health care, improve health, health, health, health, is you going to go in in this and not just improve health care, improve health, health, health, health, is you going to go in in this and not only make better improve health, health,
Thank you very much.
I'm here for sharing <unk> <unk>
Or is it <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, you are pictures that you can't take on with their cameras.
My interest in the photograph was a woke up with my first <unk> digital camera for 15 years.
And I was mixed with my whole passion before I was drawing about, but was a little bit different because of the camera the camera the camera the camera <unk> <unk>
And when you take a photograph of a photograph of the camera the camera the process ends the process ends up really is <unk> <unk>
For me the photograph was more than to do with is being in the right place, right at the right time.
It seemed that anybody could do this.
So I wanted to make something something different about a process that we would press <unk> <unk>
<unk> like this to this is one that this is this this is this is a one of a very <unk> road <unk>
But he's got a <unk> turn.
And even though it holds a level of the <unk>
Or pictures of you like like dark and dark <unk> <unk> and dark <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And when I say I say I say to say <unk> I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that it can be <unk> -- but I always want you to think that look like to look like that it looks like to have it look like that it looks like to look like that it looks like to have it look like that it looks like to look like that it looks like to have it look like that it looks like
So let's get a <unk> one that you will have to be thinking about a moment to figure out the trick.
It has more to see with capture an idea that with capture a moment.
But what is the trick trick trick makes it real.
They're the details or <unk> <unk>
Do I love light?
So what do we create the <unk> of the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is sometimes illusion in perspective.
But in the end end is how to do the world is to interpret the world and how you can perceive is to perceive with a <unk> <unk>
It's not really about whether it's realistic about whether it's like to be about if it's realistic about it is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I look at it as a puzzle of reality that we took different pieces of reality pieces of the reality of reality the reality and actually create an an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example of simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> <unk> thing that we can all all relate in three-dimensional world.
But combined it somehow can we create something something that is <unk> <unk> <unk> as if we had existed.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's go back into the brain because the brain don't embrace the fact that that doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process of the process we combine to combine the <unk>
It is really about combining different <unk>
And the things that they do is a picture look like to be a picture look like realistic to you -- -- all the things that are around us in our everyday lives.
But when you can combine it is very important to do is you combine this is very important to <unk> because other way something to bad.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules to go to get realistic results.
As you can see, these pictures are images very special.
But <unk> can you create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures have to have the same perspective.
Secondly, the <unk> pictures have to have to have the same kind of light.
And these two images are coming with with these <unk> <unk> were taken at the same height and the same height of the light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the way to distinguish the way of the other different images with different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where are it <unk> <unk>
Here's another example.
You might think this is a picture of a landscape and a landscape and the landscape and a landscape and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But this picture is totally composed about all about all about all of different places.
In the personal I think it's easier to create a place that you can actually put in <unk> in the same ideas that it has on your head.
But it's a lot of hard planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter knew that I had several many months to <unk> to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was that was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are all in a different location.
The <unk> <unk> was just captured in a stone well.
And yes, I even did a red red <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So to make a result a realistic result a result is realistic result of I think we need to do a lack of planning.
You always start with one <unk> idea.
Then you have to combine these different different pictures.
And here each piece is very well <unk>
If you just do a good job when you taking the pictures the result of the pictures that result can be very beautiful and beautiful and very <unk> very <unk>
All the other tools are there and and the only limit limit of our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start to start with a slide on technology, very boring.
Please So please do if you can <unk> it.
It's a diagram anybody that I took from a folder <unk>
I'm not going to just show you how to show you how to show you the way to show you the way to you show you the very much show you for me to show you the way to you show you the point to show you the way to you show you the point to show you the way to you show you all that you can show you
It's about an analysis that we were doing about the power of the existing microprocessors <unk> <unk> were going to be able to vote against power <unk>
The interesting thing about this is this is this is that this is that this is this is that this is that this is this is that this is this is that this is this is that this is this is that this is this is that this is this is that this is this is that this is this is that this is this is that this is that
In other words, every step here represents a order of magnitude on scale <unk>
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a new thing.
So here's something something going to happen.
And that's what I'm going to talk to you.
Please So please light light light light up. light away. up.
It's more intensity more intensity, because writing about paper.
Why would we bring it to the <unk> curves technology to <unk>
The answer is is, that if you draw to you in a normal curve that we say, these are the years, or a time time -- or a time unit, or a time time -- -- and a time time, -- -- and this would be any as much as the technology that is the technology that I would like to <unk> the diagram of the technology that I would
It would be something something like that.
It's not very much.
But if you <unk> -- for example, some other technology, technology like transportation, on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> would be very silly, would we see a straight straight line. out.
But if something is something like this, it is a <unk> change.
If <unk> <unk> technology is as fast as <unk> we spent last past <unk> last morning we last happened tomorrow we was past last morning we would last last <unk> last morning we last happened -- tomorrow we last last morning we was next past tomorrow we was next past the past we last last <unk> last morning we last happened tomorrow we was past last morning we would last
But don't we go back to that <unk> rate.
There is there's an unprecedented unprecedented <unk> in the history of technological <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> every few years of orders of orders of magnitude.
The question I want to pose is is -- is to is you look at these are these <unk> curves <unk> <unk> You can see that it's not still still for forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as fast as it goes.
We were going to get a one of two things.
Or well it will be just going to turn into a typical curve of curve this until something is something completely different, or maybe do something something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm a optimistic, so so I think maybe something something like this.
If we would now be in the middle of one transition.
In this line we're in this is transition in one transition transition in a transition transition out to be the world -- to a new way.
So what I'm trying to wonder, and ask you, is, what is that new shape that you have the world is.
How new is new that new state is going to come in the world place.
The transition is really <unk> <unk> if we are engaged in.
I remember about the future happen in the year 2000 people were to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we can see the future it is still be the year 2000.
That's all that we see.
In other words, the future is <unk> <unk> year year after the year after my lifetime.
But I think it's because we felt something that is going to do.
And we can also have a transformation in a transformation, a transformation. We can actually feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have much sense to be about to think about 30 or 50 years, years, it's all going to be so different in a way that we extrapolate what we're doing today is doing today is no way to make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about what to you about how could it be, how could it be that transition that we would <unk> is.
But to do that have you have talk a little bit bit about things that you don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to you get to understand it, to understand it, is a distance distance away and look at all the long time.
The scale of time is going to like to do this is the time of life life on Earth.
I think this image is a sense picture of sense if we looked at every billion years.
So we go back back to a half thousand years of years when the Earth was a great <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If we look at the way these chemicals organized <unk> we got a sense of idea how things happened.
And I think there is what theories is to start to start understanding the way understanding of the origin of these <unk> -- -- I'm going to tell you a simple version of this thing -- and that is, at that time, there were only about oil <unk> <unk> <unk>
Some of those of those of those oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals they made to bring out to bring materials from the outside of the outside of them, grew up grew in. out on the outside. out.
And they started to <unk> them.
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms of these them <unk> <unk>
But those drops were not alive -- in the current sense, because each one of them had a contained one one of them there was a contained by random prescription recipe for chemicals.
And every time you got to get out, on, are going to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk>
So every <unk> it was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that is kind of is going to be better being <unk> being better at the time of we putting the chemical <unk> grew up, grew up, more chemicals and <unk> more <unk>
They were often lived in often lived in time, they were more <unk> out.
It was a way of a life form of life, life life -- is very simple, but but but the things is interesting about when these drops were really excited about, when these drops is interesting to when these drops would learned the trick trick.
In some other way that we don't really understand very well be very much very good at <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were to learn to store information for information, the cell is the cell, in a special <unk> called DNA.
In other words, it was going to focus on in this particular evolution of sense, a writing system would allow you to record what they were to be able to be able to go on.
The amazing thing is that that life system seems to have have remained <unk> stable from that that has evolved two and two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, our genes have exactly the same code, that same information <unk> system.
In fact, each other living living is expressed is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did just about <unk> <unk> we can just write things with this code.
Here I have one here is 100 <unk> <unk> from white dust from white dust from white dust -- white dust that I'm trying to hide to hide the U.S. <unk>
But <unk> I took this <unk> <unk> The code has all use to use in this -- -- -- and I wrote my personal data on in this piece of DNA at this piece of DNA and read it 10 at the <unk>
So if someone wants somebody to want to do is a 100 million copies of copies of my personal card, my personal card <unk> I got a lot to all of all of them <unk> in fact, for every single world in the world, and is in here.
If I was a <unk> it would have put place on a virus and would have it it it for the room.
What was the next little <unk> <unk>
Writing DNA was interesting interesting.
This is that that these are cells just got these cells happy -- many other other <unk> <unk>
But then I happened another great step happened in which things were very excited about, and was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information to form that communities cells.
I don't know if you know, know about it, but can exchange for DNA.
So in that way, for example, we evolve antibiotic resistance.
Some of these bacteria they found the way to avoid avoiding penicillin up to create their little little DNA with little little <unk> with other bacteria bacteria -- to creating their little little <unk> to penicillin because bacteria are communicate. out.
This is also place place that you have place to become a way of the communities that, in the way, they were together in that way, -- and study a <unk>
So in this <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> them together, whatever is that if a community was very successful all of the individuals of that community are <unk> <unk> more -- for evolution.
And the inflection point is happening when these communities was very close on, and they decided to write the whole recipe for the community of the community that the community is together in a single chain chain.
The next interesting stage was interesting about for life life took another other <unk> billion years.
And at that stage, we have a whole communities of these communities of different types of different different types of different different types of different different types of different different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are actually an <unk> community.
We have many many cells that are no longer just not working. anymore.
The skin cell of skin is not without heart without the heart, or of the brain, and forth.
So these communities were evolved to and became more interesting levels of us than the cell phone, the cell phone, something that we call a new organism.
The next level of the level that is the next level of these communities in these communities.
These were these <unk> <unk>
And to build a very special structures that they did not make much more than process information is process about process about.
They're the political structures.
The neurons are the devices that process and process the information that those individual communities <unk>
In fact, they started to <unk> inside the community being responsible for us to understand and convey the information to convey information.
Those were the brains and and the nervous system system system system system system system system system system is in the communities.
And that gives you an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> to the length of an organism, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So one could, for example, you would not eat some little fruit up a little bit wrong and sick and sick the last time she ate it.
That could happen happen during life life happen on during the life of an organism given one organism given to one organism because they had these information processing information processing data processing information processing data processing information processing information processing information processing information processing data processing information processing data processing information processing data processing information processing data processing information processing data processing information processing data processing information processing data processing
So the fact that the nervous system was building built up really hard for information information that of evolutionary process <unk>
Because evolution could now happen now happen confined confined to one individual.
It might happen happen in the time we need to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the communication trick.
So for example, the most <unk> <unk> <unk> know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very very complicated idea of an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm here sitting here sitting in, emitting emitting a <unk> <unk> and hopefully building a very similar idea, vague and <unk> <unk> in your heads <unk> <unk> a certain analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated we made it sound sound sound sound sound sound sound sound, in sound sound sound sound, and produce a something very complicated in another brain.
That is now that we start to start to start to start to start to start working as a a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we started to perform <unk> <unk>
We now went through similar through similar periods the <unk> <unk> organisms <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For example, of the language of language that was a small step in that direction.
The <unk> <unk> video tape tape -- -- -- are the specialized mechanisms that that we can now built to do is handle that information change.
And that brings us into something much bigger and bigger and able to evolve more than we were doing before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk> <unk>
You now saw the evolutionary <unk> evolutionary <unk> of <unk> that that has some sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of some sort of evolution with the <unk> <unk> program <unk> <unk>
And we've now we accelerated over time on time again. again.
The first stages of the story that was telling you a billion years each.
The next few hundred stages, the nervous system and brain, take about hundreds of millions of millions of years.
The <unk> and forth -- less than a million million years.
And again, as the electronic electronics, seems like to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> <unk> I guess you know, <unk> -- is this is the right name of something that we name is something that <unk> its own pace of its own rate of change.
The more quickly it change it faster and faster it.
And I think that's what we looked at in this is in this is on this is explosion in the <unk>
We can see that the process is <unk> <unk> <unk>
But I get life to design computers designing the computers -- would not be possible without the technical <unk>
But now design of design objects of such complexity it would be impossible for me to do with a conventional <unk>
I don't know that every transistor is it makes every transistor is that every transistor is that is that every transistor is that every transistor is that is that every transistor is that every transistor is that is that every transistor is that every transistor is that is that every transistor is that every transistor is that is that every transistor is that every transistor is it makes every transistor
There are thousands of millions. million.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we think a level of abstraction, it abstraction, we put it on the machine machine, and the machine it does is something that you were able to be able to do before, it is much much further and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and much faster and faster and faster and faster and
In fact, sometimes it uses the methods that we don't even understand that.
A particularly interesting method I have been using is <unk> is the evolution itself.
We put up inside the machine an evolutionary process evolutionary process is going to operate on the scale <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolved a program from a random sequence of a random sequence of instructions. of instructions.
We said, "Please you can run a hundred million sequences of instructions <unk>
You could just run these <unk> sequences out at random -- run all all these programs, and take those things that we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want. I want.
Let's say that I want to just order the numbers <unk> to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that more close to order to order to <unk>
Of course, it's a little bit likely that a few random sequence random sequences of the instructions, of instructions, <unk> <unk> <unk> numbers, numbers, none other things did.
But by course, it was able to figure out, see two of two numbers at the right order.
And I said, <unk> <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequence random sequences that you better have <unk>
We were going to look at those and <unk> the rest.
And now we get the best ones going to get up to <unk> out.
And let's go back back to <unk> following a <unk> process of <unk> <unk> <unk>
Let's take two <unk> that we have two <unk> that we have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and that children are going to have the properties of both both of these these these these these these those these two two programs.
So we got to get a whole new generation of a <unk> <unk> <unk> programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please ignore the <unk>
Go back again. again.
We were going to get a few few different mutations in.
It is trying to new and forth again with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few few different milliseconds. <unk>
So I can do about the equivalent for millions of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes to -- or complicated, a few hours.
At the end, we end up with video programs in such way.
In fact, it is much much more efficient programs have much much more efficient in a much more efficient thing programs that that I could could have been written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
And I've tried to look at how to see how do they work.
They're a dark <unk> <unk>
But do you get the <unk>
In fact, I know yes, I have the safety that the goal of the goal because of us get the goal because of a hundred hundred thousand programs that they could do it.
In fact, their lives depend on do that.
He was once in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and take a card card, and say, "Look about this.
He says, <unk> plane plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> makes you feel <unk>
We know the engineering processes don't work very well when they get <unk> out.
So that's why we started to depend out about computers about computers to depend out about computers of the computers are going to depend on computers of the computers are going to depend on computers of the computers are going to depend on computers of the computers are going to depend on computers of the computers are going to depend on computers of the computers are going to depend on
And that allows us to produce much much more complex things than that makes the normal engineering.
However, we don't really understand about all about all the other choices that it is.
In that sense, it's going in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much much faster and so can be able to run these programs very much much more quickly.
I mean, it is <unk>
The thing is getting faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and so much <unk>
Because all all of these technologies <unk>
We are <unk> out.
And we're in a time we were in a time analogous to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're the <unk> <unk> and we cannot not understand what the hell on Earth is creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something something comes behind with us.
I think it would be very arrogant would be very arrogant be very arrogant is that it would be really be very arrogant is that it would be really be very arrogant is that it would be really be very arrogant is that it would be really be very arrogant is that it would be really be very arrogant is that it would be very arrogant would be very arrogant
And I think we all all are all part part of all of the creation of what is that it is in there.
But now you come now is lunch and I think that stop me stop here before I was born.
I think we have to have to do something with a part of the medical culture of the medical culture of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this is start with a little bit of with a <unk> doctor, and that is me.
And I would just spend time enough to let me give to give me a piece of my false fake <unk> <unk>
Before I try the issue of my talk, talk, talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're all about the end of the end are the end are the end are the <unk>
We just love baseball, baseball, right?
baseball is full <unk> full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> <unk> talk about statistics of the statistics and used to use it to form a great baseball <unk>
I will just focus on one one of them and I hope that many many of you have heard of.
It's called the average <unk> <unk>
And we talked about a <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
That means the bat bat bat <unk> bat bat <unk> bat <unk> <unk> <unk> three 10 <unk>
That means is going to launch the ball of the game field game field, without <unk> <unk> and any one that tries to <unk> to the first base of it to the first base of time -- to the first base of time -- to the first base of time -- to the first base of time -- to the first base of time -- to the first base, it
Three of 10.
You know what they call a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Great <unk>
Well, this is really good -- maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
By the way, that one is one one of 10 car <unk> 10 car <unk> -- hit it.
<unk> like the legendary legendary Ted Williams, the last player was the <unk> <unk> High <unk> <unk> <unk> more 400 strokes in regular <unk>
Now I have to get this to my world my world much more comfortable -- or maybe less uncomfortable, you tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> <unk> are <unk> -- attached to a surgeon that has a <unk> record of 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose you live in live in in a very clear <unk> <unk> <unk> has two <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and their family family members derived by a way to a <unk> record <unk> <unk>
But know what? something?
She's she is getting better getting up in a long <unk> <unk>
And their hits <unk> <unk>
This is not work.
But I'll ask the question to you.
What do you think that is the average point of hits of a heart of a heart surgeon or <unk> <unk> a nurse <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were very good.
And the truth of the matter is, that no one in all of medicine is the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or <unk> <unk>
What we do, though, is it <unk> the world, and would include myself with the mandate <unk>
That I would -- -- would you ever ever ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that we would <unk> when I was at in medical school.
I was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Once, I was one time in a high school in high school said that by Brian <unk> high school for a blood test.
Just like that.
<unk> in my little <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> General <unk> <unk> General <unk>
And I learned all all about memory.
Out of my kind of my kind of the kind of the <unk> <unk> <unk> the origin and work with muscle work, <unk> <unk> every day that comes out of comes out of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And even even even know of the <unk> standard diagnosis about how to <unk> <unk> <unk>
And while we got to raise more and more <unk> more knowledge.
And I was going very well; I graduated with <unk> me.
And I could just stop from the school school in medicine with the impression that if we were to <unk> everything, and would it know everything, or know everything -- or close it close to all the time, because of the mistakes.
And it worked for a time, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident a resident a resident a resident a resident in a university hospital right here in Toronto Toronto when the lady to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time I was assigned to the <unk> <unk>
And when the emergency emergency room is why do we consult the way we consult to a cardiologist cardiologist <unk> I was going to go back at that patient <unk>
It's going to report the head of the head of the <unk>
When I saw the lady <unk> <unk> <unk>
I heard a sound <unk> <unk>
And when you <unk> <unk> I heard a sound <unk> on both sides, what was that <unk> <unk> <unk>
In those conditions the heart stops working with, and instead of pump the blood forward, your blood is going to your lungs, your lungs, your lungs, show your lungs, your lungs, your lungs, your lungs, show your lungs, your lungs, your lungs, your lungs, show your lungs, your lungs, your lungs, your lungs, show your lungs, your lungs, your lungs, your lungs, show your lungs, your lungs, your lungs, your
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did this is what I did that, and I started working on treatment for the treatment that that <unk>
I gave it <unk> <unk> and medication to help alleviate the pressure pressure in your heart.
I read it to the <unk> water pills water so that it can actually <unk> it.
And in one time or two, she started to feel better.
And I felt very good.
And there was I when I made the first <unk> <unk> he sent your home.
I actually made a two more mistakes more.
He sent her home to his house without talking about the head of <unk>
I did not put up the phone the phone, and I should actually be done, was to call my boss and my boss and <unk> <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, would have it, it, it, it would be able to bring this information <unk>
Maybe I did for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident a resident to <unk> care.
Perhaps I wanted to be so successful and be so successful and could take care care of my patients without even contact with me.
The second mistake I made was made this was worse.
When I send it to his house, didn't get me just attention to a voice in my inner way that was like, <unk> -- is not a good idea.
In fact, it was so insecure as even one that I was asked the way up to the way I was going to go back to the <unk> <unk> "Do you think it's good if of your <unk>
And the nurse thought and said, with total <unk> "Yes, I think that is being right."
And I remember that as though was yesterday.
So it was like to sign the high high at the <unk> and the ambulance is ambulance with the <unk> they brought them to his house. house.
And I went back to the hospital. hospital. hospital. hospital. hospital.
The rest of that day -- that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> <unk>
But I kept up with my job.
At the end of the end of the day, we were going to go to leave the hospital parking parking lot where my car was going to go home.
It went through the emergency emergency room emergency room emergency room emergency room emergency home.
And there is another other nurse, another <unk> I heard of the lady <unk> before, this was three words about words that three words that most emergency medical doctors <unk> <unk>
Other specialists specialists were afraid about, too, but there is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The three words are: you know about it?
"It is basically the patient who sent his <unk> <unk>
He asked the other other way of the other <unk> <unk>
And "Well, she will be <unk> with the same speech <unk>
She was okay.
But I went back up and on the edge of the death.
After I was an hour in one time we had come to a time you've reached his house, after I had the high at the high school, suffered a <unk> and he suffered a <unk> and he suffered a <unk> and he suffered a <unk> and he suffered a <unk> and he suffered a <unk> and he suffered a <unk> and he suffered a <unk> and he suffered a <unk>
I just just breathing and was blue.
The emergency personal <unk> <unk> <unk> all its resources.
They gave you medication to raise the blood pressure <unk>
And they put a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> <unk> and <unk> up to the core.
It was a <unk> mix of feelings because after the <unk> it was <unk> and intensive and waiting for all that are <unk> <unk>
And in the two or three previous days three of the next few days of the last day it is that that we have <unk>
He had a <unk> <unk> brain damage.
The family got together together.
And in eight or eight or eight or nine days, nine days, nine days, you was going to get away what was going on going on.
And in the ninth day, they left him to go. go. Mrs. <unk> <unk> wife, mother, wife, wife, wife, wife and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
So the next few hundred weeks ago, me was going to me for that and experience the <unk> shame that there is in our medical culture -- and I just feeling that healthy shame good because you can't <unk> with your colleagues.
You can make the peace and more makes it that mistake.
It's that shame is that you let a teaching.
The <unk> <unk> that I talk about is how to make us feel very wrong with us very bad at us.
It's the one that really tells us not that that we do was doing was wrong, bad, wrong, we are bad guys.
And he did really feel.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk> <unk>
I talked to the family, and talk to the things and made sure it to the things and made sure that they do not <unk> me.
And I was just just going to just get out going off getting back into getting into the same one.
Why did I not ask my <unk> <unk> why do you sent to your home?
And in my worst <unk> <unk> Why made I made a mistake that <unk> <unk>
Why did I chose medicine?
Little on that feeling was <unk> <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in a day you <unk> the sky came out, and finally the sun was, and wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with myself in me that if we were to <unk> the efforts to be perfect for not <unk> <unk> <unk> do you stop those voices.
And he was.
I went back back to work.
But it went back back.
Two years years later, it was in the emergency emergency department emergency department in the emergency emergency department of the emergency hospital in a community hospital in the northern Toronto, Toronto, and I got a man about 25 years of a while in the throat.
I was really busy and busy <unk> <unk>
And he was going on here.
I looked at his throat, I looked at her throat, <unk> <unk>
She sent him penicillin penicillin and he sent his home.
But while he was running the door door door door door, still pointing out your throat. <unk>
Two days later, when I came to my <unk> my head <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in his office.
And I did the three words: <unk> <unk>
Remember the patient that by a pain in <unk>
He came back back up, and I had no <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition potentially deadly call <unk> <unk>
You can see it for Google Google Is it's an an infection, it's going to go at the top, and that it is going to make the close one from those tracks. out.
He, luckily, we did not <unk>
They would have been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I went through the same time period of embarrassment and thought, later on, go back up, and work on, until it happened and again and again again again again again again again again again again over again and again again again again and over again and over again and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially to work on in a hospital, because of it <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both of them not send them home home, and don't I think about it is that it was a <unk>
One of one of them I thought I had a little <unk> <unk>
And I was just going to get a <unk> X-ray <unk> but just turned out, a normal one, a colleague who was looking at the patient that was some certain sensitivity in the lower bottom and the bottom is right right now."
The other patient was in with a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a
I read a liquid way to <unk> <unk> and I ask my colleague <unk>
I went through and see some certain sensitivity in the lower right quadrant, right, right, I called a surgeon <unk> up.
Both were both operated operated and and they they acquire well well well.
But every case I was left in, with me <unk> me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and many colleagues say, is a <unk> <unk>
The most significant thing has most significant have most significant have most significant have most significant have it been for the last five years.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't go back to me -- and talk about my <unk> if I can't find the <unk> <unk> I'm going to tell that what is really about, how can I share with share with my <unk>
How do I show you this to that that they do do the same <unk>
If I would go back now to a place like this is this one, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard of, you have to talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course you have to have a game you'll hear about talk about the mistakes of other people's mistakes mistakes of other people, doctors, you will not hear someone to talk about your own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, a <unk> in my hospital <unk> wrong -- wrong -- trust me and look at the eyes.
Here's the system that we have.
<unk> total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> <unk> <unk> you have mistakes -- and not people not sleep, sleep -- and the ones that people who were <unk> who who are <unk> -- who who are <unk> -- who who are <unk> -- that they who are <unk> -- who who are <unk> -- that they who are <unk> -- who who are <unk> -- who who are <unk>
And it's almost like a kind of a kind of kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have to have the idea that that if we were to <unk> from medicine people that make mistakes, they are going to be an safe to us.
But that's what it brings two problems.
In 20 years, they about 20 years of kind of kind of spread out of kind of kind of a personal study of bad medical <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what I learned about is that mistakes are <unk> <unk>
We worked in a system where mistakes are happening happening all happen on every day -- where one is one in 10 10 drug drugs are going on in the hospital are the way right -- -- in a system that's going to be right right -- -- in a system where malaria infections is right about, is not right right, -- in a system in which antiangiogenic infections are
In this country, they die 24,000 houses <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The United States Medical Institute were United States in America established 100 <unk>
In both cases, it's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> because we're not going to <unk> the problem that we should be.
And they're all about things.
A <unk> <unk> system -- where knowledge is just multiply <unk> down every two or three years, and not <unk> us.
<unk> of sleep <unk> all all all the whole whole whole thing.
And we can't just get rid about it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the patient with the same patient with one pain in a chest chest <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> eyes, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> story about contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> not do things things always the same way.
And my patients are not car cars not <unk> <unk> their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we took the system that we were going to go in, and remove all the usual professionals more likely to error, mistake, -- well, it's not going to be no one.
And with that people don't want to talk about their most <unk> <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> art. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my worst <unk> I'll tell everybody, from me from me from from the opening <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> your <unk> <unk>
And his students would <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> head and go, saliva saliva and count their stories. out.
They want to tell their stories, you want to share them.
You can just be able to say, "Look, look, "Look, don't you do the same <unk>
They need a context where we could do that.
They need a <unk> medical <unk> <unk>
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The doctor <unk> is human <unk> human is human, you can human, they accept it, and don't be proud about their mistakes, but it is to learn what happened to learn about what happened to learn about what happened to learn about what happened to learn about what happened to learn about what happened to learn about what happened to learn about what happened to learn about what happened to
It will just deal with their experiences with them.
It's support for those people to talk about their mistakes.
They will ask the mistakes in other other people not intended to <unk> -- but have a loving support and support for us all all <unk>
And he works in a medical culture of medical culture that recognizes that humans are going to run the system, and when this happens, that happens, you will mistakes that we mistakes in time at time.
My name is Brian <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I feel a lot about but try to learn something something that can we convey others.
I don't still know what do you think about think about think about me, think about me, think about me, think about me, think about me, think about me, think about me, think about me, think about me, think about me, think about me, think about me, do think about me, think about me, think about me, think about me, think about me, think about me, think about me, think
And let me just conclude to conclude with three words <unk> <unk> <unk>
Do you know how many how many decisions do decisions we take one <unk> day.
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey over more than 2,000 people and the average average amount of choices that you chose to choose to pick a average American. <unk> a half a day.
Not long ago in a research research week ago to a week to a week a week.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> <unk> for these executives <unk> to make it decisions with these tasks.
They found out on average <unk> <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every work had a lot of many <unk> <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine <unk> <unk>
Only 12 only a 12 percent required an hour or more of time.
Now you think about their elections.
Do you know how many belong in the category of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How do you mean how do we describe the way that we deals with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the other <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I want to talk about the problem with problem problem, and some possible solutions.
And while I talk about this is a few few questions, and many questions and need to know what your answers.
When I ask a question, how to be a <unk> to raise your hand hand if you want to want to burn <unk>
In other ways, when you do a question, do one question, if your answer is positive be positive <unk> for please give you <unk>
And now my first question of the day, are the day, they're ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate graduate school graduate student at Stanford University <unk> -- this level of very, very age very little was very sophisticated <unk>
It was called <unk> <unk>
It was it almost like going to go to a <unk> park.
There was there that there was 250 different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different types of different kinds of different kinds of different types of different types of different <unk> <unk> <unk> And this was when we got water water down.
I loved her going to go to the store, but on one occasion, I was asked, why why I never do nothing?
This is this is the <unk> shelf shelf shelf on the oil oil.
They had to have it was more than 75 people in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Once I decided to go to the manager <unk> and I asked him -- to get this well this strategy that we have to be offering <unk> <unk>
He was going to me the buses full <unk> from the day days -- often with their cameras.
We decided to do a little little little experiment on with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I left.
They had <unk> different kinds of different classes.
They will just take a place for <unk> right down just the entrance to the input <unk>
So we put out there it for six <unk> <unk> or 24 different flavors of all, we looked at two things: First, why are people be willing to stop the <unk>
More people were to stop when there was <unk> a 60 percent, that when there was only six percent 40 percent.
We are also looking at what case they were most likely they more likely to buy a <unk> <unk>
So here's the other opposite effect of the opposite effect.
When I were just stopped when there was only <unk> only three percent got to have only three percent got to buy it <unk>
Where were you where they stood up when there were six when there were six, you just see that 30 is <unk> <unk>
If we do the calculations, people have to have six times more likely to buy them -- if they were found out back then.
Well, I'll decide that we do not buy <unk> <unk> probably get a <unk> less good for conserving the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the drug <unk> <unk> <unk> really affects us very much <unk>
We decided to not to be able to do not to decide, not to decide, not to decide, not to decide, not <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now the whole issue of the day -- is financial savings -- financial savings issue.
I'm going to just describe a study study studio that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were interested in looking at if the number of money <unk> made available in savings savings savings savings program, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> people save for the future.
And we found that I actually had a <unk> <unk>
We were <unk> <unk> plans for two to 59 different options.
And we found that the bigger it was the much larger money number of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> really have much less participation.
So if you look at the extreme ends, we see that in the plans that we have two <unk> the death rate was about about 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that we're offered to offer about about 60 <unk> the participation rate rate rise on the <unk> <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to decide to participate, when are more options, even in that case, there are negative unintended consequences.
So for those who they decided they decided to participate, how much bigger it was the much bigger that the most more people were focused on, to avoid actions or avoid the actions or hedge funds.
As much as there were more options, they were more willing to invest in financial financial accounts at market market.
But none of no one of these extreme decisions are ones that we were going to come together to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three major negative implications negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is you to do is that we have to do this is that we do is we make the decision, the decisions that you know when this is going against own self-interest.
They are more likely to take the worst take care care for us in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The main reason is that we are going to look at that gigantic variety of giant <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- but we're not able to do the to do the calculations for which we are doing is to do the to do the to do the calculations for which we are doing is to do the to do the to do the
Today I have to show you with four very simple techniques that we have focused on one way or other research, research -- so you can to have to test in their business.
The first is <unk> <unk>
You've heard you've heard before, but it's never been more true than today, than less than today, that is less true than today, that is less true than today, that is less true than today, that is less true than today, that is less true than today, that is less true than today, that is less true than today, that is less true than today, that is less true than
People are always upset about when I say, <unk> <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually, what we're looking at more time is more and more more is that if you choose a cut, to get rid with get odd as sales <unk> <unk> <unk> will be a better experience in choice.
When I went to <unk> -- went on with 26 -- all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you saw a 10 percent <unk>
When the self-driving corporation Golden Rule <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the products for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You know the supermarket shelves today, on average, average you have 45 <unk>
In one shop in Walmart Walmart is a <unk> 100,000 different products.
But at the ninth largest store in the current world is <unk> <unk> <unk> only do 1,400 <unk> <unk> a kind of tomato tomato sauce thought. on it.
In the world of the financial savings savings world, I think that one of the best examples that has been coming out of have come up on how to do better the choices the choices for the choices the choices is about the other options that is an atom to the other choices are choices about to do the choices the choices are choices is about to the other other
All all the Harvard at Harvard are automatically <unk> automatically automatically be automatically <unk> it to a insurance <unk>
People who really want to choose, you choose, and give them 20 to them for them to be 20 or more.
You already know what people say, often say, is often say, "I don't like <unk>
These are all <unk> <unk> options.
The first thing I'm doing is to do is we ask the <unk> <unk> <unk> the differences that there are among those options.
And if their employees can not <unk> -- can't afford it, you can't do their <unk>
This evening, I was starting to start this session, I was talking talking about <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience with this audience is on this audience is on this audience on this audience -- all paid for this audience with this audience is on this audience with this audience a few <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here, a <unk> <unk>
I want the <unk>
I'm just going to leave you for a few seconds to go back, -- and give you to give you to take an applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> Okay. Okay. Anyone are ready to accept the deal.
Is it not more?
Okay, I'm just going to show you something else.
You knew there was a <unk> trick.
Who's is ready for that <unk>
I think I really was thinking to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you really have more information in the first round round of round of <unk> I can <unk> it and say that they thought that they thought about thought that they thought about what they thought that they thought that they thought about what they thought that they thought that they thought about what they thought that they thought that they thought about what they thought that they thought
Because the images were made to be more real.
This is really bring me to the second second technique to handle the ant problem with the ant <unk> problem.
So people understand people to understand that people understand what are differences between the choice, have to every choice, and that the consequences should we have to be feeling very very much very simple <unk> way very much very much very very big <unk> way very much very much very very, very serious <unk> way.
Why is people spending about 15 percent more 30 percent more by the average when it uses of debit cards or credit cards, that when it uses is used to be used.
Because it doesn't look like real money out real.
It turns out that you can actually make it make more real real, it can be a very positive tool for people to <unk>
We did a study with <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> these people were in a <unk> a meeting where were they going to have a <unk>
And to that meeting is exactly how are we <unk> <unk> we got a little <unk> <unk>
What we added we had to add the <unk> we were to invite the staff to the staff that you think about positive things that <unk> <unk> <unk> in their lives if they were going to come in, in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> <unk> and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or save or what do they want to put on in the <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk> <unk>
We can drive more handle more categories in categories than other options.
For example, this is a study study study that we did in a hallway hall sign.
We saw what we found out in supermarkets, him throughout the <unk> <unk> <unk> show of magazines can contain from <unk> different kinds to <unk>
But you know?
Because there's a <unk> tell me how to do it be?
These are two <unk> <unk>
One is called <unk> <unk> the other <unk> <unk>
If you think the one on the left the left is <unk> <unk> and on the right one is <unk> give you just give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few few things.
If you think the one on the left the left is <unk> <unk> and on the right one is <unk> give you just give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out that's right.
The one on the left is <unk> <unk> and on the right is <unk> -- know what?
This is a <unk> <unk> completely useless.
<unk> must tell something something that we would not <unk> you guys to <unk>
You can actually see this is this problem with these great lists of funds.
Who are supposed to be <unk> for.
My fourth <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It turns out that we can drive much much more more more much more more information than what we thought, if only do you get a little bit.
We have to have to increase the amount of breakthrough.
I'm going to show an an example one example of what I mean.
Let's have a look at a good little <unk> <unk> buying a car in a car.
This is a <unk> German manufacturer of cars cars <unk> <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions and put on your car. car.
And these are things vary vary in the number of choices that offers each other.
<unk> color out of the car, you have got 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
So what I'm going to do is what are going to do is what are going to do is what are going to do is what are going to do is what are going to do is what are going to do is what are going to do is what are going to do is what are going to do is what are going to do is we do is
So half the half of the customers are customers are going to go in a lot of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of a lot of lots of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of
The other half of the customers are customers are going going to go in a little little bit <unk> options, four -- to 56 colors. <unk>
And what am I going to <unk>
How do you are.
If you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you mean you're <unk> <unk> or <unk> we are being being being lost.
We found out that that many many other choices are going to come from many many other choices to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> over again and over again.
<unk>
If you go from a few few choices to many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, -- many, many, many, many -- continue there.
Same information, the same information, the same information <unk>
The only thing I did was to do is the order where information is presented with.
If you start with the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
Even though the pick of the changes of the change are <unk> not say about all the preferences <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you can have to choose.
We are excited about a product a product that we are now building that now is really close up with us with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four <unk> techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
All those of these techniques that I've been presented with were was designed in were designed in order to help go handle handle on the <unk> or better for you, to use it in their own business issues, or for the people that people work.
It's that I think the key to to get the best one choice is to be careful about <unk>
And the more careful we're going to be in our best we have to practice the art in choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> years, we were <unk> in the East Eastern Germany, <unk> <unk> if you had a <unk> machine <unk> to write about it to the government.
You had to record a piece of text of the text of example written by the machine.
And this is why the government can track the origin of the texts.
If they were to find a written written written written written written through the wrong message wrong message wrong message wrong is wrong -- is the way to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this is how much that we would -- will the freedom of expression.
We will never do that in our countries. countries.
But today, with you in 2011, you if you buy a laser color printer from a big big manufacturer big manufacturer big manufacturer in large big manufacturer big manufacturer of big manufacturer big manufacturer in large big manufacturer big manufacturer of big manufacturer big manufacturer in large big manufacturer big manufacturer of big manufacturer big manufacturer in large big manufacturer big manufacturer of a big manufacturer big manufacturer in big
That's what is really happening today.
And no one seems to be very much very much good at this.
This is an example of the ways our governments are using technology use technology against our own citizens.
And it's one one of the major causes of major causes of problems in major problems in the major network.
If we see what happens in the world online online line, we can put into the attacks of their <unk>
There are three main groups <unk>
Are you <unk> <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> city in Ukraine.
<unk> <unk> it's very easy to understand.
These guys are making money.
They use <unk> to make a lot very much good money, a big number.
There are there really many many of a <unk> <unk> <unk> online, <unk> <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is this one is Alfred <unk> <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are them Matthieu Matthieu <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing online jobs online, but illegal media is going through to steal money money out the way up of our cards when you get information from our cards when we bought on a <unk> computer.
The U.S. secret American secret American U.S. American <unk> of American America, two months ago -- -- of this sir, of this guy, Sam <unk> -- and this point was <unk> for millions of millions of dollars when was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> You know your <unk>
And I'm saying that today is more likely that any one of us is to be a <unk> victim of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is bad about the worst.
In the future, most crimes are going going to live on. on.
The second group of this is important in important today is not very driven by money.
There's one other thing that the moves, were going to determine them, the protests, they motivate the opinions, they motivate them laughter laughter laughter.
Now, groups like Anonymous have Anonymous <unk> <unk> over the last 12 months of the last 12 months of the last 12 months of the actual online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do for money, the <unk> as Anonymous are doing for protest for protest and the last group are doing to be protest in for protest that to protest -- and the last group are doing to be protest that for protest that for protest and the last group are doing to be protest that for protest and the last group are the
And then we see cases as the <unk> <unk>
That's a good example of government attack government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands, the Netherlands is that it was.
<unk> The last fall because of a <unk> <unk>
And I will make a place security on the site and make a <unk> <unk>
Last week I was at at one last week with a <unk> meeting with the leaders from the Dutch government <unk> <unk> asked one of the leaders when <unk> <unk> <unk> people have death death because of the attack <unk>
And the answer of he was yes.
So how do people die out about the people to a attack of these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk> they <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website -- have a website with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Except that we <unk> <unk> <unk> foreign <unk>
And they were going to get the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> <unk> happened exactly exactly that.
And what happened to happen in the Arab <unk> and those things that have happened, have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> secret secret <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The among those papers was talking about called <unk> <unk>
And within that folder had had notes of a company in a company in a company in a company <unk> company based in Germany who had the Egyptian government <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the communication of the country.
They had been sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The <unk> <unk> right here.
But anyway, West governments have to provide the tools to <unk> <unk> <unk> they do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also also doing this as well.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago there was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> used by the German government to investigate their own citizens.
If you're a <unk> <unk> <unk> in a criminal criminal case -- is you rather obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today you go further up there.
It will be <unk> the connection to the Internet.
We will even use the tools in the <unk> <unk> <unk> to infect our computer a <unk> to allow them to see all the whole use -- and listen to the online <unk>
When we think about hard about things like these things that the obvious answer should be a bad thing, but don't really affect me, because I'm an impact on because I'm a honest person.
Why <unk> <unk>
I have not have a lot to <unk> it.
And that is just make any sense.
It's in play a game game.
Privacy is not <unk> <unk>
It's not a question of privacy <unk>
It's about freedom against control.
If we could well be trust in our governments today, in 2011, you any right right to <unk> today, will be forever.
We would blindly vote on in the other future government, in a administration that we could have been in 50 years?
These are the questions that we should have been worried about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live alive. I live in live in, live in, live in Kenya, in the south <unk>
These are the <unk> from my dad, back, and behind the empty <unk> National Park.
The National Park National Park, doesn't scale National Park, don't most part of the south, what it means that we wild animals like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And predators, I have a bit like to stick them, follow them, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one one that we were killed at the night, and as soon we wake up in the morning and <unk> I was very sorry because it was the only one that we had.
My <unk> <unk> believe that we came of came from from the sky and all the land to <unk> <unk> <unk> so much.
So I grew up a lot about lions.
They were dying people were dying of our community and protect our community and livestock and also also be angry at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is just so few few of them in Yellowstone <unk> in Nairobi.
A child in my community, in age six to the age of age six to the age of her father and and this was the same thing that was going to me me.
So I had to find a way to figure out a way to solve this problem.
My first first idea was to use fire, fire, because of the lions were afraid of.
But I was really realized that it really is really not <unk> -- because even even help the lions see the lions see the pen <unk>
I won't <unk> <unk>
A second second idea was to use a <unk>
It was trying to <unk> the lions to make them believe that was about <unk> <unk>
But male lions are very smart.  they came -- the first day and saw the <unk> and they were -- but the second day, they went back up, and said, this is not moving in, --  -- so just jumped and killed them.
So one night I was walking around the pen from a pen with a <unk> and day the lions didn't come from. out.
I discovered the lions are afraid of the fear of light fear that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got to get a switch switch up on and turn off the lights out.
And this is a little little little bit <unk> lamp. of <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell can is, you can see, you can see -- as you can see, the solar cell can see, you can see, you can see, you can see, you can see, you can see, you can see, the solar <unk> you can see, the solar cell <unk> you can see, you can see, you can see, you can see, the solar <unk> <unk> battery
And the <unk> <unk> makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> where are the lions.
And that's what they see is what lions about when they come from night.
The <unk> lights <unk> and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking at the <unk> -- but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since we had never come back back up to have trouble with lions.
And the houses in the neighborhood in the neighborhood in the neighborhood, you heard the idea.
One of them is one of this <unk>
And she had a lot many many many many animals the lions and asked me if I could put the lights out.
I said it is.
You can see the <unk> you see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, of the time, I've put up in seven and seven home in my community and get a lot very much.
And my idea also is also use for now be used by all about other predators like <unk> <unk> <unk> and it's also using to be 11 out of them to <unk> elephants from the farms.
Thank you for this <unk> I was fortunate enough to get a grant a grant a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> very excited.
My new school now is now helping is to raise money for funds and raise money to raise the money to <unk>
And I even took my friends in my own community and installed lights out the lights in the houses that they don't have it, and show them how to do it go.
So a year a year ago, was only a kid at all the meadows of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my father used to watch airplanes to fly, the fly, I used to see airplanes how to fly, the fly, they can fly, the fly, and was that one day I would one day inside one.
And today I am.
I got the opportunity opportunity to come in a plane for the first time.
My great dream is to be a way to be an engineer being an engineer in <unk>
I used to hate people to believe it, but now as my invention is now saved up to my <unk> <unk> and we can can be with with the lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> Whatever my language means, -- thank you <unk>
Chris Anderson: So you don't think about you picture you picture -- picture you -- is to hear a story like yours.
So you got a <unk> <unk> Richard <unk> <unk> Yes.
CA: You're all going to be working on other electrical <unk>
What is the next one in your <unk>
<unk> My next invention is -- -- is -- -- I want to do a close <unk> CA: One nearby <unk>
<unk> I know this is already already been invented in the <unk> <unk> <unk> but I want to do the <unk>
CA: So I'm just going to go at it once, once, right, and <unk> <unk> <unk> I have tried to know that, but got a <unk>   --  -- -- you --  -- at the <unk> Richard canyon. Richard backs Richard <unk> Richard <unk> foot, Richard feet.
We're going to go back at every step that we would ever <unk> -- friend friend to do.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little kid, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up with singing a song called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was feeling very proud.
In school, we spend all all about the rest of the rest of the world, except that the Americas, South America, Japan are the enemies.
But sometimes I sometimes wondered about the rest in the world, I thought about happen to happen all my entire life in my life in North Korea, all the way all changed.
When I was seven of seven years, I saw my first public deal.
But I thought about my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and old myself not hungry.
But one day -- in 1995, my mom brought home a my <unk> my sister.
That was like, "When we were going to get this, this, the five family members of the family will stop there in there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We are <unk> <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
I was very <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was the first time I heard people were all in my country.
At the short time, when I was walking in front of the train, station, station, train station, I was walking in front of the train station, train station, a train station, I was walking in front of the train station, train, I was walking in front of the train station, train station, I could walk in front of the train station, train station, I could walk in front of the
A <unk> woman without life was living on in the street, the street, holding a child to <unk> in his arms looking at her face of his mother looking at her face of his mother looking at her face of his mother looking at his face by looking at her face in her mother looking at her face of his mother looking at her face of his mother looking at
Nobody <unk> one because they were really concerned about taking care for themselves and their families. themselves.
A huge <unk> <unk> North North Korea was <unk> <unk>
At the last one million Koreans died in famine for famine and only few people survived grass, grass, grass, grass, grass, insects, and eating grass, you eating grass, grass, them?
They were also getting more and more frequent <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was always asked why they had light light up and not.
This is a picture of the North North Korea North Korea North Korea, the North Korea <unk> <unk>
This is the <unk> river called <unk> <unk> which is that is that is that is that of the boundary between North Korea, and China.
As you can see, the river can see, the river -- can see the river really be <unk> -- at certain points, enabling Koreans <unk>
But many of many people die.
Sometimes I would see the bodies floating on in the river.
I can't not reveal the details about how I left from North Korea, the North Korea, <unk> but I can only say that for the years of famine I was going to say that for the years of famine I was going to say that for the years of famine I was going to say that for the years of famine I was going to say that for the years
But I just thought it would be a separate separate separate return separate separate separate separate return separate out separate out of my family in short short time.
I could never have imagined you have imagined imagined that it would take a 14 years to come back to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman to live in my family. family.
I had no idea how life would be like to be life that life would be like to be life about as refugee <unk>
But I was soon learned that it's not only just be just extremely difficult -- but because the Syrian refugees North Koreans are North North Africa was considered illegal <unk>
So I was living in with a constant fear of my identity out <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to a horrible <unk> back back in North Korea.
A day a day, my worst nightmare nightmare was actually done when I was arrested for the Chinese police police me in the police station.
Somebody had been accused by being <unk> <unk> then I would go to my skills in the Chinese language language, the Chinese language and <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> out.
I thought my heart was going to calm off.
If not natural seem natural, natural, it could be natural, natural -- could it be natural, natural and <unk>
I thought that my life was going to come on. up.
But I got to control my emotions and and answered the questions.
At the end of the length of the time, one officer said to the other, this was a false report fake -- she's not <unk>
And they let me go. go. It's a miracle.
Some North Koreans are in China looking at asylum <unk> <unk>
But many of many people can can be arrested by Chinese police, <unk>
These women were very lucky. <unk>
Even though the previous had had had was <unk> were <unk> were <unk> were going to were released after a sudden last <unk>
These North Koreans weren't so much lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are countless <unk> are been captured in China and <unk> <unk> the North Korea, <unk> <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
But although I was fortunate in <unk> up many many many other North Koreans North Koreans, many other Koreans haven't have much <unk> so much.
It's about this is tragic that North Koreans Koreans have to hide their identities and fight that hard just to survive.
Even after we learned to learn a new language and find work, all work, all the world you in a time.
That's why is that, after 10 years of hide my identity, have I decided to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the end of South Korea.
And I started a new life over again. again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much better challenge to what was expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, South Korea, the South, I had to start learning to learn my third language.
And I also also understood that there was a great big gap between North and the South.
We're all <unk> <unk> but inside, we have come to be very different because of the <unk> <unk>
He even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Where am I? me?" me?
Suddenly, I had no country a country that I could call it with me.
Although I went back to the life in South Korea, it was not easy to do a plan I started studying for the exam exam exam exam test.
Right now, when I was starting to go back into my new life, life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea authorities of North <unk> <unk> some money that money was sent to my family, and, as punishment happens, my family was going to be shifted going to be shifted going to be shifted going to be shifted going to be shifted going to be shifted going to be shifted going to be shifted going to be shifted going to be shifted going to be shifted going to
They had to have that they have to have just run away immediately as close again.
So I started to plan how to it escape.
North Koreans have to travel long travel long distances on the way for freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the boundary between North North Korea, and South Korea,
So, ironically, I took an flight to China and <unk> <unk> to the <unk>
Because my family couldn't talk about Chinese, Chinese, you, somehow, for over three thousand miles across China and go through from Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and were almost caught up several times.
Once, our bus was time and tackled about a official Chinese police officer officer.
He asked all all the way up and started asking questions.
As my family couldn't just understand Chinese, Chinese, Chinese, Chinese <unk> I think my family was going to be <unk> for.
When the Chinese official came up to my family <unk> <unk> I was standing on and I told him that they were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were doing all the way up to the way up to the <unk>
But I had to spend most much all my money to bribe <unk>
But even even after spending the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned around the cross <unk>
After I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and got incarcerated to the other time in <unk> capital.
This was one one of the most low points of points in my lifetime.
I did everything for free my family and close in, but my family was <unk> in prison <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was going and came up between the <unk> <unk> and the police station, station, the police station, station, the police station, my family family.
But I didn't just have enough money to pay for any more bribes or <unk>
I lost a lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man said, "What's the problem?"
I was so surprised you that one unknown would you ask ask.
In my poor English poor, English and with a dictionary, I explained to the situation, and without <unk> the man went on to the <unk> <unk> <unk> all the rest of money for my family for my family and for other <unk> <unk> <unk>
I went back up with all my entire heart, my heart, she said, "Why is what to <unk> me. me?"
"I'm not not <unk> <unk> me.
"I am not like, "I'm just like, "I'm just like, "I'm like, "I'm just going to help the people <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment that is a symbolic moment a really be a symbolic moment a really be a symbolic moment a symbolic moment that a really be a symbolic moment that a really be a symbolic moment that it's a symbolic moment that a really be a symbolic moment that a really be a symbolic moment that's a symbolic moment that a really be a symbolic
The kind unknown, a new hope for me for me and for the <unk> people to <unk> <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of the kindness the kindness of the international community and international community is the hope that the people were <unk> <unk>
Over our long journey, my family and get together in South Korea,
But but they can actually get their freedom is just half the half of the battle.
Many Koreans are separated from their families over to a new country, they start to start with little <unk> <unk>
So, we can now benefit from the international community of the international community with education in the English language of language, English language, English language, practice of work, English language -- in language English language, and try to benefit that of the international international community by the international community with education practices of the English language, language of language, English, English language -- in language of language, English language --
We can also act as bridge a bridge bridge bridge bridge a bridge bridge a bridge bridge bridge a bridge bridge bridge bridge inside and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue to keep in contact with with family contact with family <unk> you can still get information and money information and money information and money information is helping to change North North North Korea, North Korea.
I've been a very <unk> I've got a lot of good aid and inspiration and inspiration up in my life, why I want to to giving North Koreans, a chance to thrive in North <unk>
I'm sure you're going to go to see more and many more North America, you know, all all around the world, including in the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I live in <unk>
This is the <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk> <unk>
So the planners back to the city city city planners together and thought, we're going to go to change the name of the South Center the South <unk> it represents something more, so they changed the way into rural L.A., the way they changed it to the South L.A., Los Angeles Los Angeles Los Angeles L.A., such time that happens, -- is actually really bad in in the city.
This is the same time -- <unk>  <unk> <unk> fast food, terrain.
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, people live in a food desert way, live in a food desert in food in food, <unk> <unk> <unk> home to the places in food to take and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that the places of food food is going to bring people killing more people than food food in your car.
People are dying out of <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood, is five times larger than say, Beverly <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was just going to see that that happen.
And I ask what would you feel like if you would feel whether you would feel like if you don't have access to healthy food, healthy food, you see the <unk> effects you can see is that that the current food system is current now has been <unk> in <unk>
I can see, I see is I see is I see is I see a <unk> <unk> and sold as a <unk> cars.
I was looking at <unk> centers, <unk> centers, <unk> centers.
And I think this is to stop.
I think the problem is the way that the problem is problem is about is the way about.
The food is the problem problem, and it's the solution.
And I also already got tired to run tired out of manage to run up to run up to buy an apple <unk>
What I did, was to plant a plant of food in front at my house.
In a <unk> city of the land that we called a <unk> <unk>
It's about this is 45 feet for 45 <unk>
The point is, that belongs to the city.
But you have to do it <unk>
And I was like, "Well, can I do what I'm me to do what I'm really come in, wins, because it's my responsibility for, and have it <unk>
This is how I decided to get it <unk>
So my group -- and I, L.A. L.A. <unk> <unk> <unk> us and started to plant our forest into our food, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you know, nine up nine up all the way up, you know, nine up all the nine full <unk>
What do we do, we are kind of kind of a little <unk> <unk> <unk> paid ahead of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> all all the whole city and completely volunteer, and all and all and all and everything we do is for free.
And the <unk> was beautiful.
Then somebody was a <unk> <unk> out.
The city came to me over and on me and <unk> me a <unk> <unk> saying that I had to take my own garden, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was like, "Come on.
A <unk> court order for plant -- plant food in a piece of land that one is <unk> --   -- "Well, do you go."
Because this time was not going to going to happen.
L.A. <unk> had the story written by Steve <unk> for Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> members of the Arab <unk> <unk>
We had to get the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even mean <unk> <unk> and <unk> what are we doing all about.
I mean, come on, come on, come on, why not?
L.A. is the city city in the United States in the <unk> <unk>
It has 68 <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's the equivalent to 20 <unk> <unk>
That's space space space for plant <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why does the hell on Earth do the hell on Earth do the hell on Earth do the hell on Earth do the hell on Earth do the hell on Earth do the hell the hell on hell on the hell on?
We were to take a plant plant a single <unk> <unk> 10 thousand thousand seeds.
When a dollar <unk> I'll give you about 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> <unk> when I tell people to the people, it <unk> your own food.
<unk> your food is like to print your own money.
You see, I got a legacy for <unk>
I grew up out there. <unk> my children there.
I was going to become a part of this <unk> reality of <unk> <unk> <unk> reality was <unk> for me for me -- my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> me growing up in art.
Just like a sort of an artist <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> walls, walls, I <unk> walls, <unk>
I use the <unk> the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and trees -- are my <unk> <unk> <unk>
It will just look at what the Earth can do is, if you just stop canvas.
You just can't just imagine how amazing things that is a <unk> <unk> and how does it affect the people.
What happened?
I witness my garden my own garden up a way of education <unk> <unk>
To change the community, you change the community, you have to change the composition on earth.
We are the land.
They were just going to look at how it affects the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act <unk> and provocative people can do, do -- especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk> <unk> out.
And I remember one one occasion, that came a mother came in and her daughter, daughter, <unk> the night <unk> <unk> and were in my front garden, <unk> salt out and look very <unk>
I, well, man, I feel a bad thing that they were there, and I said, you know, don't you have to do this as do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when to see people that people were so close to me with hunger, how do I do this, what do we do this, -- people are going to come -- -- -- not matter about what people going to steal your <unk>
I mean, God is God not not afraid that you're going to get it in.
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it is about.
I want you to <unk> it for a <unk> but once you want to get it to get it back at your <unk>
There was another time I put a garden in a <unk> shelter in a <unk> shelter for <unk> <unk> <unk>
There were these guys, that they helped me download this is <unk> <unk>
It was great, I gave her stories about how this was really struck and how they used to plant her mom and her mom and her grandmother, <unk> and was just going to see how this was changed, and was so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> <unk> has to plant it to plant it maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a time -- -- like about 50 people who come from, work and work out, all all in plan volunteers.
If the kids are growing up, you guys were going off the kids to eat them.
If you <unk> <unk> you will eat <unk> <unk>  But don't people teach you how the food is really excited about, if you are not taught how food is really excited about, if you are not taught about how food is really excited about, if you are not taught how the food is going to affect the mind and body, your body <unk> you in front you.
I saw young people who want to work, work, and have this thing that you have seen of color that you are on in this way for them, that it doesn't take anywhere. anywhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity opportunity that we can train these kids that they were going to get away from their communities in to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next thing is next next the next George George <unk> Washington Washington <unk>
But if we not change the composition of the land, we would not change the composition on the land, we will never do.
Now this is one one of my plans -- this is something that I want to do.
I want to plant all a whole block of a block away from gardens, where people can share share food food on the same block.
I want to take a <unk> and turn them in the <unk>
I won't <unk> me.
I'm not talking about all about free things because because it's free for free up.
The funny thing about sustainability about sustainability, is sustainability about sustainability, is you have to have it <unk>
So what I talk about is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is to do is we
What I want to do here, we have to do it sexy sexy.
I want everyone to all become a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Marx.
We need to change the script of the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk> <unk>
Did you take <unk> take your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
That is your gun your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to go to meet with me, -- well, if you want to look at me, don't you call me if you want to sit on in the comfortable chairs and sit comfortable and comfortable sitting and comfortable and sit comfortable, and sit down in happy chairs and happy chairs and talk to doing some shit.
If you want to see me, see me, you come to come on to the garden garden garden garden <unk> so that we can plant a thing.
Six Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk>  -- --  -- you will all all agree with me that this is this is that this is that this is a very kind of <unk>
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is going to is a good material to drive, not always, always, especially in days of days of days -- where a lot.
You can have a lot of great amount of water in the asphalt we can <unk>
And especially if you're going to go on on your bicycle bike, these cars around, that's not very nice.
In addition, the other <unk> <unk> can do a lot very long noise.
It's a loud material material -- and if we built out roads, like in the Netherlands, we were very close to cities, very close to cities, we want to a <unk> <unk>
The solution for is that is make roads from asphalt asphalt asphalt asphalt asphalt asphalt <unk>
The asphalt asphalt is a material that we used now to now is now use right now in most many roads in the Netherlands, the roads of the Netherlands, the roads in the Netherlands, the roads in the Netherlands, the roads of the Netherlands, the roads in the Netherlands, the roads in the Netherlands, the roads in the Netherlands, the roads in the Netherlands, the Netherlands, is Netherlands, is pores
Noise will be also going on in these <unk> <unk>
Because it's a very long thing going to -- all go out -- so is a a very quiet move.
It also has <unk> <unk> <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you have <unk>
What is a <unk> <unk> watch that in this road the surface the surface is <unk> <unk>
First one is first one to do that.  -- --  -- won't do that.  -- don't you hurt your <unk> <unk>  -- don't you hurt your <unk> <unk> --  -- not do you do that.    -- not do that.   -- not do that.   -- not do that.   -- not do that.   -- not do
And finally, this can also be able to bring more close to more and more and more and more <unk>
Sometimes you can create bumps deep <unk> <unk>
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, that you can be converted into a problem, but -- but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see what the damage appears in this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt is like is this is a <unk> asphalt <unk> just like I said, just just have a small amount of <unk> <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> <unk> light <unk> the <unk> this <unk> <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are you going to go ahead and get off from the <unk> <unk>
So if you drive on the road the road, you get to <unk> how we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> <unk> then we probably be able to have a have to have a good solution.
So what we can do is to do is use this is use <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> little bits on the <unk>
So then we have asphalt asphalt is asphalt asphalt is asphalt asphalt asphalt with with little little bits of little <unk> <unk> <unk>
Then you need a machine, machine, as you can see here, you use to have a <unk> machine <unk>
<unk> can rise, especially steel is very good at that.
So what is you to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> <unk> flow through these <unk> <unk> and <unk> back up again.
Today I can just use a <unk> <unk> because I can't actually bring the great machine <unk> <unk> <unk>
The microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave oven, microwave oven, microwave <unk> is going to be like. on.
I put the sample, I'm going to look at what happened.
This is the sample that you get out now.
I said that we have this kind of the industrial machine machine went in the lab to <unk> <unk> out.
So we tried a bunch of many samples of samples out there and then the government, really see our results, and thought, "Well, that's this very interesting one.
So we had a set of a little piece piece of road, 400 feet of the <unk> <unk> <unk> where we had to do a way a lane of trial to prove this material.
So that's what we did here -- -- here -- see where are we doing the road test on the road, and then, of course this road last several years of the damage -- -- -- that's know about the <unk>
We took a lot of many samples of this road up the road and test them in in the lab.
So we did is what we did aging is a lot of burden we put together as much much load lot of charge on them, <unk> then with our <unk> machine <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can just repeat this many many many times.
Well, to conclude, point, I conclude, I can say that we made a material made a material on by using the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- using <unk> energy to <unk> the surface of the surface of the surface, the road, you can actually double double a lot very much very simple <unk>
And now, of course, you have curiosity if this was also going to do it too.
We still have this shows up here. It's pretty hot.
You actually have to cool it first before I can show you how it acts for you.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember to have woken out one morning with the <unk> sound at my house.
My father was listening to BBC <unk> in his little <unk> radius.
He had a great smile in her face that was unusual about time, because the news is often about it?
The Taliban <unk> <unk> <unk>
I did not know what to do that, a <unk> but see what to do that, a <unk> but could I see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school <unk> <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was only six years of when the Taliban were got off of Afghanistan and illegal girls to go to school.
For the next five years of me -- as a child to <unk> my own older sister <unk> I could no longer be used out -- alone -- to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we had two <unk> <unk>
Every day, we were just going to take a different route way different route out a way for anyone to be suspect about where are you going to come from. out.
We had to hide the books in school bags bags of the market it look like we were shopping. on.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us <unk> <unk> in a small room.
It was a nice thing in the winter, was extremely <unk> <unk>
We all know that we were to <unk> our <unk> <unk> teacher, students and our parents.
Back in a while, the school had suddenly a week for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us do.
They were <unk> out. out.
Did you know where are we <unk>
We were just going to be <unk> -- but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very fortunate to growing up in growing up in a family where education was <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time. time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. Afghanistan -- <unk> her daughter, my daughter, my daughter, <unk> out to the school and why his father <unk> <unk>
But but my educated mother <unk> was a teacher. teacher.
This is it.
She went back up two years ago, only to convert our home school in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first one his entire family in getting education.
There was there any question that their children had to have to get education, their daughters, despite the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For him, there was a greater risk for me not to educate children.
Over the years of the <unk> <unk> I remember that there was moments that I was very frustrated about our life life, and was always afraid not to see a future.
I wanted to give a <unk> but my father was like, <unk> <unk> a daughter of mine -- can lose everything you have in life.
You can just steal your money money, you can -- can you help you to leave your home for a war.
But there's one thing that is always being with you, with you, you here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, to pay it.
So you still want to do is you not <unk>
I was 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed destroyed by decades of war.
Less than the high school is <unk> engaged in engaged in engaged with my education, <unk>
Instead, I was very proud to really proud to graduate <unk> <unk>
When I went back back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, <unk> my grandfather, which was <unk> for his home for the courage to educate his daughters, to educate their daughters, <unk> <unk> <unk>
He is not only going to get away from my <unk> <unk> first woman, I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who I took it driving down for the streets of Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I was in big -- but my family has even more big dreams for me.
That's why is that that I'm a global ambassador, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a global campaign to educate the women.
That's why I cofounded to <unk> the first one and probably the first private school in girls in Afghanistan, Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls going to go to school.
The exciting thing is, is I see the students in my school students in my school with the very hard desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I look at his parents and their families who, like my mine, <unk> for them, despite the front of the <unk> <unk>
As a <unk> It's not his face, and I can't just show you your face, but face, but -- but know, Ahmed is a father in my students.
Less than a month, he was born, and his daughter went on way from the way back to <unk> to his village, and was literally filled out of being killed by a bomb on the way.
When I got to get his own daughter to the school, they would go back to try.
<unk> now, if <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter's future -- for my old old old old <unk> <unk>
So what I've realized what I've noticed about Afghanistan, Afghanistan, which is something that it's often forgotten in in the West, is that behind the most majority of those people <unk> -- there is a very majority of the people <unk> -- there is a most majority of those people <unk> -- there is a very majority of the people <unk> -- there is a very majority of people who
It doesn't just mean that our mothers have not mean that our mothers have not been going to say that our mothers have not been going to say that our mothers have not been going to say that our mothers have not been going to say that our mothers have not been going to say that our mothers have not been going to say that our mothers have not been
In fact, it's the first <unk> <unk> compelling <unk> of their daughters, but in a context of a society in a society as the of Afghanistan, we need the support for men.
Under the <unk> the girls who were going to come in -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is that different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the <unk> <unk>
And I'm afraid these changes were going to not last long a lot, after the retirement U.S.
But when I go back back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school students at my school students in my school students in my school school, and my parents who <unk> <unk> <unk> I see a future for <unk> <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country country expectancy and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and every day the girls in <unk> <unk>
Like me, they dream of big.
Thank you.
Never I have never forgotten the words from my grandmother, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But But you never get to go back into a revolutionary <unk> <unk> <unk>
They've almost spent nearly two years since the the revolution was known was <unk> were inspired by the congestion <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
A forces with many other other citizens <unk> <unk> <unk> in the country to call a day of a <unk> day to call a day of a <unk> day to call a day of a <unk> day to call a day of a <unk> day to call a day of a <unk> day to call a day of a <unk> day to call a day of a <unk> day to
And they <unk> it was a big revolution.
Women Women were <unk> <unk> were in the middle <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> freedom, and social justice and justice.
They've shown the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> brutal dictatorship <unk>
They've shown a great sense of sense of solidarity from the <unk> <unk> <unk> all all the way up to the south.
Finally, last one of a <unk> period of six years of the six months of a brutal war and brutal war around about 50 50,000 dead 50,000 people were dead, to release our country and <unk> <unk>
However, I <unk> it was left with a heavy charge charge, a legacy of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For four decades of the <unk> <unk> regime destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure in society <unk>
<unk> of the devastation back and the challenges, I had wanted to do, with many many other women women, to rebuild -- -- to rebuild the civilian society <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> transition between democracy <unk> <unk> a model between democracy and the national reconciliation return.
There are about 200 <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall <unk> about 300 in <unk> <unk>
After a time of a period of 33 years of a period of 33 years of 2006, I went back back into Libya and a unique hand, I started to organize workshops <unk> on the development in capabilities that capabilities -- and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women founded the <unk> we founded <unk> women <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> autonomy of the women <unk> the women and for our <unk> <unk> autonomy autonomy -- and for our poverty <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I found myself with a very hard environment, in the <unk> <unk> <unk> an environment <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the selfish policy policies of domination and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was to be and successful.
Women won a National Congress National Congress National Congress National Congress in the first election in 52 years.
However, I was just at just little, the exhilaration of the elections and the elections and revolution was <unk> <unk> every day we found news out of the day.
One day we first woke up with the news from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Another <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Another day we would woke up with the news from the murder state of military officials in the army.
And every day we every day we woke us with the government <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> human rights citizens of the people and lack of the law.
Our society became a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> more is clear out of the ideals and principles of freedom, social justice, social justice we had to have the first beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icon of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here at all right now to do with you with our story of the success of the success of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Rather, I'm here here today to be here today to tell what are we, as a country to confess that we, as nation, we're doing a nation, we <unk> badly, we made the wrong decision.
We don't not <unk> well.
Because the choices were not brought in peace, the stability and security security.
The <unk> list were <unk> and <unk> the <unk> between candidate candidates and candidate women brought to peace and reconciliation at it.
No, they didn't.
What happened to happen then?
Why is our society <unk> <unk> <unk> and have it with selfish political policy policies policies of domination issues of the men for women?
Maybe what was missing only women, they were missing women, but but are the female values of female values from compassion, <unk> and <unk> it.
Our society needs to have a society need to do is our society need to do is our society need to do the election do the election now need to do the election -- is just going to take polarization for polarization and <unk> <unk>
Our nation needs the female <unk> performance of the other than need <unk> <unk> <unk> and use it.
We need to stop acting as agents of computing agents and <unk> <unk>
We need to start to act how agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female discourse a female speech, not only <unk> but put it in the <unk> <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> <unk> <unk> rather than <unk> <unk> <unk> rather than <unk> the <unk> rather than <unk> the <unk> instead of <unk> <unk> rather than <unk> <unk> <unk> rather than many of the <unk> <unk> <unk> rather place of <unk> <unk> <unk> rather place of the <unk> <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, us have to do this is the end of reach the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> <unk> that is about the <unk> and <unk> <unk> between women's perspectives and <unk>

The man, I who was a man, one that I was going to love more than anyone in this world, she put a gun back into my head and <unk> <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell the story about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a blind <unk> that is fall in a year millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of a million million women, and even some other men.
It could far be a story.
I don't a look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a good survivor of the domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> English English was English at Harvard <unk> <unk> <unk>
I've spent most bulk of my career working on for companies of the list -- <unk> <unk> <unk> among me between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> <unk> <unk>

So my first message for you is to do is that is that that my first message for you is to you is that is that the domestic violence can you anyone, -- all all the other races, all the other religions, of us all all about all the time of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that you all think that the domestic violence happens -- is women who is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of those <unk> are <unk> are men -- and domestic abuse -- only is going to in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> relationships in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> relationships in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> relationships in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I would just have said that it would be the last person in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world you
I was 22 years old, and in the United States of the ages of ages of ages ages of the age of 16 and age of them have three times more likely to be a <unk> three times more possibilities of being victims of being victims of the way to be being victims of being victims of domestic violence victims of domestic violence are victims of being victims of the
I was also going a typical victim a typical victim because he didn't know about anything about domestic violence -- that their warning signals or their warning signals in it.
I met <unk> in a cold <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was sitting there in my side in New York subway New York subway subway room started <unk> <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he also had just <unk> from a University of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and work on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what was the most impressed me in the first encounter of first encounter was just fun and fun, and that it was a kid in the field.
I had a lot of big <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most clever things that was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the <unk>
He did it mean about all the first <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we started out out and loved out out out and loved him out and loved him everything from me -- that I had had to have been to have to Harvard, that he was wearing passion to help girls teenagers, girls teenagers, and my work. work.
I wanted to know everything about my family my childhood, my childhood dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me as a writer and as a writer as a writer and as a woman, as anyone had ever done before. before.
And it was why the degree is back to in that <unk> school was <unk> at that <unk> school was in that <unk> school is in the <unk> school and school at Wall Street Street and his bright future had so much important for him.
I did not know that the first phase in any of the domestic violence of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I did not know what know the second step the second step for the second step over.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was was to do was was that was was to do was was this is I go from New York York City, and leave the work of my dreams, but just thought that I had to do sacrifices for your work and for your work, <unk> work for your dreams, but do sacrifices you have to do anything, do it sacrifices do
I had no idea that he was was going in in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that was coming in head in head in a physical <unk> physical <unk> <unk> carefully <unk>
The next step the next step of the domestic violence is domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence violence to see how it reacts to it.
And here is where you go in into the scene those <unk> come in.
As soon as we go to the New England New England you know, that place where we was supposed to <unk> -- had to have it feel that safe they bought three <unk>
One was one one thing in the <unk> <unk>
Another <unk> kept her underneath the pillow in our bed and third third always in his pocket.
And he was saying that I needed to need these guns <unk> because of the trauma trauma long trauma one that lived as small.
I needed it to make it be safe.
But these guns were actually really serious about <unk> <unk> every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> <unk> happened about five days of our wedding.
They were seven in the <unk> and still had <unk> <unk>
Five days later, after the 10 bruises on my neck had <unk> <unk> I put my father's <unk> <unk>
In spite of what happened, I was sure that we were living living for forever, because I loved her as and loved it very much.
And he was very, very <unk> <unk>
It just had a very good sense of sense of really <unk> <unk> for the wedding wedding time and form a family to form of a form of me.
It was had been an isolated accident, isolated accident, isolated accident, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I spent two times more on our <unk> <unk>
The first time I was driving down into a <unk> secret <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> me so hard in my head <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then, a couple of days later, we drove back back out of our our way of our <unk> <unk> and traffic traffic in the traffic and dropped a Big Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac a big Mac cut cold Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac
It was just going to go for one or two times a week for the next two years, and a half years of our marriage.
I was like, <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three of three American women are Americans is going to be victim a domestic violence a time in his life, and life, and the Center for Disease Control Disease Disease Control informs every year 15 year 15 is <unk> <unk>
So, really, I actually have a very good company.
To go back back to my question: why do I get myself about?
The answer is simple. simple.
I didn't know that he was walking out of me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, woman, woman, who was deeply <unk> in love with a deeply <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> one person in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the
The other question that everybody's all about is going to do is, why are you just not <unk> out.
Why don't I <unk> <unk> me not <unk> me, could I have have have have been going to have a look at it.
For me this is the most sad question and painful question and painful question for me, because of us, the victims, we know what are you going to be <unk> -- is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase of the domestic violence is domestic violence is to kill her.
More than 70 percent of the killing in the cases of domestic violence are the victim to the end is relationship, because of the <unk> have nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even though that is <unk> -- have financial <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> financial resources -- the family court system to <unk> the victim the victim to the victim the victim the victim to the victim the victim the victim for the victim the victim for the victim the victim to the victim the victim the victim to the victim the victim the victim the victim
And we still keep wondering what is just not going doing?
I was able to <unk> it because of a last <unk> ended up up up the way my denial. <unk>
I realized that the man who was going to loved so much, much would you have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
He told the whole whole whole whole thing to the whole whole world -- the world -- all about the world: my friends, friends and family, friends -- whole people today -- because all all of me because of you.
We got a tendency to <unk> victims as good <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The question, "Why are you <unk> for?
For some people is a way to say <unk> fault fault <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of men that they want to <unk>
But since I had heard hundreds of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories
Because it turns out that really am I actually be a am a a victim and a good domestic domestic domestic violence is very typical -- very typical <unk>
I got to marry a nice <unk> kind and kind and kind and got those three two kids.
I've got that black <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What will you not back back back to have it ever have more, ever be even -- is a <unk> <unk> <unk> my head on my head back into my head back into my head back into my head back into my head back into my head back into my head back into my head back into my head back into my head back into my head in my head
Right at this moment, they are thinking, <unk> -- -- -- this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I can I assure you is that there are a few few people that I'm listening to me right now, that are you being <unk> <unk> or get a little bit <unk> or have it <unk> themselves.
<unk> might be affecting their daughter, sister, her best friend right now.
I was just able to put in end up in the end of the end of my crazy love love -- love -- crazy love to my particular love, particular love -- particular love -- crazy love to my particular love, particular love -- particular love to my particular love, particular love, particular love -- crazy love to my particular love, particular love -- particular love to my particular love,
And I'm still doing it today.
It's my way one way to other other victims, <unk> other victims, you know, is my last request towards you.
Talk to what you've ever heard here.
Noise is only in silence.
They have the power to end up run with domestic violence domestic violence -- just shedding light light on over it.
The victims we need all all about the world.
We need every one of you to understand the secrets are secrets about domestic violence.
Take the abuse to the light talk about it with their kids, their friends in work, and family.
They would have their view of the survivors like people and have fantastic people that have a future <unk>
They will make the lead signs into the violence in violence in violence in violence -- to intervene on the way up their climb climb up and show the victims out a safe <unk>
Together, we can turn our way our way up, our tables and in the <unk> safe sure and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. And I call myself Cameron <unk> <unk> and a while, I'm a model.
To be good for for you for for me for for me for for me for for me for for me for for me for for me for for me for for me for for me for for me for for me for for me for for me for for me for for me for for me for for me for for me for for me for for me for
And I feel like right now, is there that is this time is there be a moment of a time time is there is going to feel that at this time is now have have have have been dressed up --  --  -- hopefully I bring his clothes up.
This is the first change of clothes at a <unk> <unk> so you have a lot of a lot of <unk> <unk> I think so.
If some of the women were going off in the way up, you don't have to do it -- now -- now, -- now, but figure out later, on Twitter.
I also want to point to point that that I've got the privilege to be able to change what you think about just 10 seconds.
Not everyone has that opportunity.
And these are a lot less bad that I don't have to use them.
The worst part is going to go to go through this sweater through the head, because it's when they're going to make fun what do anything -- do anything for me cover me.
All right.
Why did I actually do that?
It's been embarrassing. <unk>
Well, I hope not much as much like this is picture.
The appearance is powerful, powerful, be <unk> <unk>
I was totally changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, ever a boyfriend, in real life.
I was fully uncomfortable uncomfortable and <unk> the back back into the back and <unk> <unk>
Of course, with surgery a surgery or an artificial <unk> it was like to do two days ago for the work, there are you very little bit that we could to do to do to turn our way way to transform our way around, which, as a superficial <unk> it has a big impact on our lives.
So today, for me, be brave is being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, model.
Because I'm a nice woman, and white, and in my workforce, that is to be a good girl <unk>
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a <unk> way.
The first question is, how is it going to be a way to be model? in.
And I always say, <unk> One <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The real reason I made a model of model -- is because he won the genetic lottery. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we haven't only defined is defined the beauty as defined is defined the beauty as <unk> to <unk> <unk> also have have have have have been biologically programmed to <unk> -- also have we have biologically programmed for <unk> <unk> we also have associated with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> tall <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that's my model my heritage <unk> I've known to take to take to take to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience that now are now about in the audience now is now about in the audience now are now going to do, right now, -- and maybe there are some some some certain amount of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
First, the <unk> are all going to be able to know so much about amazing models.
But unfortunately, I got to report that in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The next question question question that people are always going to do is, it can be a model model when you need to be <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, do not do we really vote for me about that.
But then, what would I really tell each each each one of these girls <unk> is: why? Can you be what you want.
You can can can be president from the United States, or <unk> <unk> the next door, or a next one is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and poet, it be awesome, what are you the first time.
If I after this <unk> one list is next spectacular list list, still <unk> <unk> I want to -- -- I want to be a model, model, I say, <unk> my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
To say that you get most much more you want to be a role model is to say that you want to win the lottery a lottery when you might be older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose. for.
I'm going to show you everything that I learned in 10 years of a model, because of the <unk> surgery <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> right now.
I don't know, know what happened there.
Sadly, again, once you can <unk> you want to want you to want you to want you to want you to want you to love that you wish you want to you want to want you to want you to want you to want you to love that you want to do that you want you to want you to want to you want to want you to want to
The next question question question of people always do is if all all the pictures are <unk> out.
And yeah, it's pretty much to <unk> all the pictures, but all <unk> <unk> just a little bit small part of the stuff that happens.
This was the first picture that I was left in, and also have the first time she used a <unk> one <unk> and I didn't even even have even have my <unk> yet.
I know we're going to go on in the personal field, personal land, I know what are we going to go on in the personal field, personal land, but know we're going to be moving into the personal field, personal land, but I know we're going to go on in the personal field, personal land, I know what are we going to get into the personal field, personal field, personal
This is how I saw my grandmother a few months before. before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came to me.
Here I am on here on a <unk> <unk> a few days before the pictures for the French <unk>
Here I am with my <unk> football team here in the <unk> <unk>
And this is all me today.
And I hope you can to realize that you realize that you realize that I'm not going to realize that I'm not me in me in those photos.
They are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of all of their <unk> and <unk> and forth to create this.
Well, the next question that people are always going to do is, you do is to do it do you do are it <unk> for free?
I have a lot of a <unk> <unk> <unk> and I could never use, before, the very privilege that I get get to get in in real life, and we don't speak.
I grew up in Cambridge, a time I went to a shop, and I forgot to take money money, and got it for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling in with my friend friend who was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a light in red in red and <unk> you and get a little sorry, agent for order to be able to keep <unk> in.
<unk> of these privilege by my way way, not for what I'm sorry, and there are people who is paying for a price price for their matter whatever they are. are.
I live in New York, the last year last year, of the teenagers who were couple and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and most majority of them were young men guys.
And only there are only <unk> <unk> young men and men were in New York, so for them, it's not a matter about <unk> <unk>
It's about how many times would I get out about, you and <unk> it.
When I did research for this talk, I was found out that that is 53 is that that is 53 that is 53 that is 53 percent of the girls in 13 years of 13 years in 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and have your body <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the last question that people do do is, the last question that people do do is, what is the life life life is like.
And I think the answer is waiting to do is, if you're just be a little bit thinner and you have the <unk> <unk> you feel very happy and say.
And behind the cameras, cameras, we give an answer that maybe we have it?
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also also incredible be able to work to work with creative people <unk>
And that's all the way, but it's just one part of what happens, you never said in front of the cameras what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm just because I got to have to have to look for me for my whole day every day.
And if you ever gets asked, on, with a little little bit thin legs, and more thin legs you the most thin legs and more thin legs and the most thin hair that bright hair -- and more <unk> be more happy?
You only have to meet a bunch with a bunch of models, of the models, because they have the most <unk> legs <unk> <unk> more <unk> the most <unk> legs <unk> the more <unk> <unk> the most <unk> legs <unk> the more <unk> <unk> the most <unk> legs <unk> the more <unk> <unk> the most <unk> legs <unk> the more <unk> <unk> the most <unk> legs <unk> the most <unk>
But especially it was hard to look at is a hard to look at a situation to look at a situation of race racial and racial racial oppression of racial school and gender -- when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to hold from this talk talk, I hope you all all feel more comfortable at the power of the image of the image of the image of the image of the point in the point that we have about success and success success.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since that was good enough to hold on hold on hold a camera, but share with you my 15 little <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
There was no <unk> <unk> directors, <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a little <unk> <unk>
In fact, most majority they took them they take them they took them them they took them space tourists by the <unk>
My story begins in the city New New York City town to give a <unk> my wife got this picture picture of photograph me this picture by holding my entire birthday. <unk> corner and child <unk>
So I happened to that we go back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to pull out the same picture.
Well, you can already imagine what is coming now going to come now.
When I was approaching my third birthday of my daughter, <unk> wife said, why not you take you to <unk> <unk> New York back in New York at <unk> <unk> <unk>
So here is when we start to ask the <unk> that we were going to take a picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of gesture will deliver the camera up to a complete stranger as universal.
No one is no one no one no one ever have no one no one no one no one ever have no one no one no one ever have no one anybody have ever been never been denied and and, fortunately, never had no one have no one have no one have no one have no one have no one have no one have no one have no one have
So then, we were not aware about how much would we change life that life would happen change our life that happen.
It became a sacred something sacred something sacred for us.
This is a picture about a few weeks weeks after of the <unk> -- and I had to to explain to my daughter that day that day is that day that gives you that day that day is that day that gives you that day that day is that day that gives you that day that day is that day that gives you that day that day is that day
These pictures are a lot more than representations of a particular time is a particular moment or a particular journey.
It's also at the physical level, the physical level -- physical, but in all the senses.
Because, because we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, changes, <unk> my daughter got new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> new <unk> I can see the life through his eyes through his eyes and see and interact with everything.
That time in concrete time we went together is something that we would hope for all the entire year.
Recently, one of the travel of the travel, we were all going to walk around, when all of a sudden they stopped in dry and signal a red <unk> of the <unk> store of <unk> <unk> <unk> store.
And I just described what had felt sense to the five years of foot in the same place.
He <unk> her first reminded your heart <unk> <unk> when you first to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what I'm looking at in New York York universities because we determined studying in New York.

Thank you very much.
Every single thing I can and all do -- <unk> my life -- -- is <unk> <unk> for seven years of work for my time for my age of my work during my age of my work during my age of my work during my age of my work during my young youth in Africa.
I was working from <unk> up to <unk> <unk> young -- -- I worked --  -- worked --  -- I worked -- -- -- -- I worked -- --  -- worked --  -- I worked -- --  -- worked -- -- -- I worked -- --  -- worked -- -- -- I worked --  -- worked -- -- -- I worked -- --
I worked for an <unk> <unk> and every project we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk> <unk>
I went back into the 21st way we were Italians were going to be doing good work in Africa.
Instead, everything is all that we were going to we <unk>
Our first project, that inspired my first book inspired my first book, <unk> <unk> <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to the people in the country in country Zambia to grow food.
So we got to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the south of Zambia this is absolutely magnificent that goes down into the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Of course, people were not <unk> -- --  -- we were just not <unk>   -- are we just not <unk> <unk>  -- were we not <unk> <unk>
However, instead of what do it was that it was such that we do do -- is God that we are here here -- -- for God that we are here here -- to God we're here here -- -- -- thank God that we are here here -- -- thank God that we are here here -- -- thank God that we are here here -- -- thank God
And of course, everything is <unk> <unk>
We got these gorgeous <unk> in in Italy, a tomato <unk> <unk>
And we couldn't believe -- believe in, we were saying to the <unk> look how to the <unk>
When the tomatoes were <unk> beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, why is why we don't have agriculture come up here -- -- --  why don't you not <unk> -- thank you <unk>
I thought only was the people doing, and and sat pretty proud to me -- pretty much quite proud about our project in <unk>
Because you can see, at least we feed them <unk>
So let's just see the <unk> --  -- see the waste that you love -- to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was organized in 2009.
Now we have delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
So I'm not going to tell it about the harm that that money has <unk> <unk>
Just read about your book. <unk> book.
<unk> a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of an African woman, <unk> the damage that we've done.
Westerners are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> missionaries <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> just two things: or <unk> <unk>
Two two words come from the root -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
However, they mean about two two different things.
I try any one of a different culture of different culture as if they were going to be, my children, you want a long much."
I try all to all every whole different culture as if they were going to be.
So white white people in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book was just a slap on in my face. "I'm small <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is supposed to be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid are aid is to is <unk>
So this morning, the guy who was opened up this conference up on the ground and said, can we -- you can see a city a city not <unk>
I decided to the 27 years old people just respond to people, and invented a system called the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> where you have never start with anyone, you -- but become a <unk> dream of become a better person.
So what do you do about do you guys do about do you do?
You can never get a community a community with an idea, and sit down with the people in <unk>
We are not working on from the offices.
We were together in a cafe. we met in a bar.
We got to have zero infrastructure zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We were to do -- do we do? -- do do we do? -- do do we do? -- do do we do? -- do do we do? -- do do we do? -- do do we do? -- do do we do? -- do do we do? -- do do we do? -- do do we do? -- do do we do? -- do
The most important thing is about passion.
You can just give an an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, that person do not do that person do you do?
The passion that she has got to have for its own growth is really much important.
The passion that man has that man has to have that man has to have his own personal growth in personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them to find the knowledge out, because no one in the world you can actually actually successful.
The person with the idea that we can not have to have the knowledge, but but knowledge is available.
So years ago, I had this idea: why not us, for one time instead to get a community to get a community to get a community to get a community to get a community to get a community to get a community to get a community to get a community to get a community to get a community to get a community to get a community to get a community
Let me tell a secret.
There's a problem with a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs will never <unk> -- and they are never going to tell you, in a public meeting, what do you want to do with their own money, your own money, your own money, you have to do with do with with their own money, in your own own own.
So, planning is a planning to have this is blind be the blind person.
The smartest people in their community, you might not know about it, because of their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work on face in face, face, you have to create a social infrastructure social infrastructure exists.
You must create a new <unk> new career. <unk>
The career is the business family in business, the company, the family family of the business -- at your house, at your house, at home at your kitchen table in his kitchen table in her kitchen table in her kitchen table in her kitchen table in her kitchen table in her kitchen table in her kitchen table in her kitchen table in her kitchen table in her kitchen table in
I started to this as a test in <unk> city Western Australia, West West <unk>
I was a Ph.D. in a time, trying to move away from this <unk> <unk> <unk>
In one year, I had 27 projects going, on, and help me see what to the question, "How can you do that?
How can you do do it?" I was like, did something something very, very difficult to do it?"
I got to get away with -- -- --  --  --  -- --  --  -- -- -- --  -- -- -- -- -- --  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
We had help us start to start this is we going to start by starting to start by starting to start by starting to start to start with it that we are starting to start to begin with.
There is there is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying out of <unk>
Peter <unk> one of the greatest <unk> traditional composer <unk> business businesses passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor professor of philosophy in getting involved in business, and engaged in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> <unk> <unk>
planning is the <unk> <unk> of the death of death of death <unk>
So now we were now going to try the <unk> rebuilding <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> not know what the most <unk> people would <unk> in <unk> <unk> want to do with their own money and their own money on and their own money up.
You have to learn how to get these people to get these people to come to talk with.
You have to offer you <unk> <unk> privacy, you have to be fantastic at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> come in large numbers.
In a <unk> community, we got to get out to get you about 200 customers.
You can imagine to imagine a community of 400,000 people -- to imagine a community of 400,000 people people, -- imagine a community of 400,000 people -- to imagine is a community of 400,000 people -- of <unk> people, the intelligence and passion?
What do you want to do is you know what do you want to do is you know what are you going to get you more to tomorrow next.
<unk> <unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm saying to tell you is that is the <unk> spirit I tell you, is that is the <unk> spirit an entrepreneur entrepreneur an entrepreneur entrepreneur told you going to tell you, is that is the <unk> spirit an entrepreneur entrepreneur entrepreneur <unk> <unk>
We are at the end of the first first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of
The internal combustion combustion internal combustion combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of you sustain <unk> <unk> <unk>
What we have to have to consider, is consider, is how to do this is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate about to seven the seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are there that the technologies that we can do this.
Who's going to invent the technology for the green revolution green revolution green, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
It'll be both the entrepreneurs and are doing it now.
There is a story of a lot of a lot of a great story that I read in a solid magazine magazine makes many, many many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to have to debate the future of New York City city city New York City city in New York last year <unk>
And in the <unk> years, we got this group of people, this group of people -- is going to happen to happen to the city New York City in New York City in New York last 100 years, and the bottom line was to the city New York City <unk>
Why?
They were already <unk> <unk> in very dung <unk> <unk> <unk> were <unk> <unk> -- this is this work technology that we would <unk> in New York.
So what happens? <unk> <unk> In the next 40 years, 40 years, in the United States appeared to <unk> generic generic manufacturing companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology to find a different way was absolutely <unk> <unk> and there were very few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few
We <unk> Michigan. Henry Ford <unk>
However, there is a secret to work with the <unk>
First, you have to have you <unk> <unk>
In other ways, they won't come to talk in a way, with you.
Then you have to offer you absolute <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then then I remember the <unk> you will have to tell you the truth about to <unk>
The smaller company company, company, company, company company, company, company company, company company, company, you have to do three things you <unk> -- the product you want to sell to sell you with a fantastic <unk> and you have to have a great management test.
You know what?
Never we have ever known a single human being in the world that can do, and sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not was born.
We have looked at and look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new new companies, new companies. <unk> <unk> <unk>
There is only one one thing that all of the successful companies in the successful companies in the world have in the world have in common, only one one: None of it was a single single person.
You would never hear the word one, it was just like this, but say that the word <unk> <unk> I was just going to just be the word that, but -- but the word <unk> <unk>
He wasn't just not just when it began. began.
No one is just begins with a company just begins with one <unk> one one.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> <unk> people come to come from in a small business <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> people who will do for you, what do you need to need it?
What can you do? <unk> do you do? You can do that?
Well, can you <unk> you <unk> -- can you look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do about it <unk> you guys that look for <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of those of us that many many many different ways to make our own many many different ways to make our many many many ways to make many many many different ways to improve our lives.
We don't all know about all the <unk> your neighbors, why not we change a lot very much good knowledge to even though are sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share more share more share with share with share more share with more share with more share with more share with more share with more share with more share with more share with more share with more share with more share with more share with more share with more share with more share of my neighbors in my neighbors in the audience
So these projects came out of questions of questions like, how much do you pay for your neighbors <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more more to borrow more things the way to the door in a <unk> <unk>
How is how to share more memories of our new abandoned buildings abandoned abandoned and better understand our <unk>
How are our hopes more to our hopes for the cows cows can our communities can reflect today is our needs and <unk>
I live in love in New York, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
My soul is always relief relief with relief <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It will always support the music.   there's a call in New York <unk>  The city has one of New <unk> --  The city has one of New <unk>  -- the city has one of the most beautiful <unk> the most beautiful <unk> in the world, but -- but also one with the greater number of global <unk> <unk> <unk>
I lived on close to this house, and I was thinking, how could I turn it in a more nice space for the neighborhood, and the neighborhood in the neighborhood that is changed my life forever. changed forever.
In 2009 I lost someone who I loved a lot.
It was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
His death was sudden and <unk> it was unexpected.
I thought about a lot about death and death.
And this is a profound profound gratitude for long gratitude for time.
It gives the significant things about my current life today.
But let's just try it to keep this up in my daily life. life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be really easy to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to catch
So with the aid of old and new friends turn the wall out of this giant <unk> house on a giant <unk> and painted on her phrases that phrases for <unk> <unk>
So the <unk> could can take a <unk> think about their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I did not know what to wait for this to expect this to expect this to expect this to expect this to expect this to expect this to expect this to expect this to expect this to expect this to expect this to expect this to expect this to expect this to expect this to expect this to expect this to expect this to expect this to expect this to
And I would like to share some of some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die I want to be a <unk> <unk> <unk>  Before I die I want to die I want to sit on to <unk> on the line of change.
Before I die I want to sing for millions of a million <unk>
"Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live outside the <unk>
"Before I die -- to give you for <unk> one time more."
Before I die I want to go to the rescue <unk>
Before I die I want to be just like to be <unk> myself."
This was this abandoned space that abandoned space is abandoned on abandoned a abandoned space that abandoned is abandoned that abandoned is abandoned that abandoned is abandoned that abandoned is abandoned on abandoned that abandoned space is abandoned that abandoned a abandoned space is abandoned in love with <unk> <unk> and dreams and hope of people have got to laugh at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's about knowing that you're just going to support the reflection back and <unk> <unk> <unk>
This happened last year, and I started to get hundreds of people about passionate people who wanted to do a wall in his community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center of the civic center in the civic center in the civic center in the civic center in the world, all the world, as <unk> <unk> South Africa, Australia, Australia, Australia, Argentina Argentina and beyond.
And we proved to show that the power of our public spaces if we have the opportunity to express ourselves it and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have have are now have have are now have have are now have have are now have have are now have have are now have have are now have have are now have have are all about -- are time and have our relationships with other other people.
In our age of the most significant force are increasing, it's more important than ever, to find out the ways to conserving the perspective and remember the way to perspective, and remember the perspective -- and remember the perspective -- and remember to perspective -- and remember the perspective -- and remember the perspective -- and remember to perspective -- and remember the perspective -- and remember the perspective and
The death is something that we often tried to avoid talking about, or even think, but understand that we're going to prepare for death for death is one of those things that we would more power.
If you think of you think about is thinking about the death <unk> our life. lives.
Our shared spaces can actually be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to improve improve improve in.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now I have a single request.
Please don't you not tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to introduce you to introduce you to to introduce you to introduce my kids.
<unk> he's got a <unk> <unk> very <unk>
Now, I'm not talking about, but is that you pass good joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what are love.
<unk> <unk> happen to what happen.
It's not <unk> <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
You don't care about the religious differences, and look at this -- never <unk>

Samuel It's got 16 years now. It's high.
Do you know the most <unk> memory more <unk>
Yet it's a selective memory.
It does not remember if in my arm in my <unk> <unk> but remember the year every year of my iPod <unk> <unk> <unk> conversations that we had four years old, I pee in my arm in my arm in my arm in my arm in my own arm for my first episode of my own arm in my arm in my own arm in my arm in my own
Do you like <unk> <unk>
But most of the people don't agree with all agree.
And, in fact, because their minds do fit into the concept of normal <unk> <unk> <unk> are often <unk> <unk> <unk>
But what it propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was, even if that was the case -- though we didn't consider them inside the <unk> <unk> that could only mean one thing that one thing is, one thing might means one thing. <unk>
Now, for those less familiar with the <unk> <unk> <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication -- affect social communication -- -- now, for those less familiar with the <unk> <unk> <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication -- affect social communication -- -- now, for those less familiar with the <unk> <unk> <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication --
In each individual you in a different way of different way of different way there, that we would sort about is to be so different from Sam.
And throughout the world, every 20 minutes, are being diagnosed -- and a new case of the development of the development that you faster increases in the world, there is no or cure any known one.
I don't remember about my first encounter meeting one day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother came to the world, and was excited about going to have a new being in my life. life.
When I spent a few few months months, months, I realize that he was was going to be different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play this as the other babies and in fact, it really seemed very interested in me at all.
<unk> was living in and <unk> on their own world, with their own rules, and I was found you pleasure in on the smaller things, smaller things in the room, you smaller things in the room room -- -- like to put up the washing machine, <unk> <unk>
As as I was growing up, it was growing up, it was growing up, it was more different, and the differences they were made more <unk> out.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration the frustration went on, -- -- there was something that it was really <unk> to a very <unk> such one <unk> <unk> nature of nature, <unk> <unk> nature -- a child, a child to see the world without boxes, a human being ever <unk> yet.
<unk> <unk>
I can't not deny that there have been a few hard moments in my family family, I wish that they were to be just like me.
But I look back into the things that I've been taught about individuality, I was taught about individuality, and communication and love, -- -- that are things that I would not want to change it for normal.
<unk> goes through the beauty that gives us the difference -- and the fact that it's different does not mean that any one is that we have any ever mean that you have any ever to do.
It just means there's a different view of a different view of what's that is right.
If I could <unk> it one thing a single thing to <unk> <unk> and Sam and to you, it is that you have to have to be normal to be.
They can actually be extraordinary.
Because they're autistic people or not, the differences you <unk> <unk> -- are <unk> <unk> each one of us have a gift inside the inner and, honestly, the search for <unk> -- is the last <unk>
The opportunity for <unk> <unk> progress and change change in the time that we tried to be as much as else.
Please. Not tell me be normal I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little little bit of what was going to have been to been going to be <unk> in the age of the <unk>
Penn State University asked me, a communications teacher, a communications teacher had to give a communication class to graduate students.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of these students with great minds, their great books and their big old words.
But when they developed those conversations, those conversations, I had have to have to have felt a sense of time when he landed on the hole in a hole in a hole in a hole in the hole at the <unk> and saw the door in a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with students with the students the ideas that they were, and wanted others to experience them that other amazing world.
And I think the key to to open to open to open that door is a great communication.
We need a great big communication of our science and engineers in order to change the world.
Our engineering and engineers are attacking attacking the way back into the environment and health care about -- and not understand and understand and do not understand and understand and do not understand and understand and do not understand what do not understand and understand and do not understand and understand and do not understand and understand and do not understand and understand and do not understand and understand and
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see what is a wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please have this <unk> <unk>
I want to share a few few suggestions suggestions about how can you do that to make sure we can see that their science is to see that their science is to see that their science is attractive to see that their science is attractive.
First question to <unk> <unk> and do what? what?
<unk> Why is science relevant to us for us.
Don't tell you just just study the <unk> <unk> they study <unk> <unk> that is the <unk> structure of our bones -- because is important to understand and try the <unk>
And when you are describing their science, care about <unk>
This is we this one is a obstacle for our understanding understanding of their ideas <unk>
Sure, you can say <unk> <unk> and <unk> but why not you mean <unk> <unk> and <unk> that it's much more accessible to us?
<unk> is not just make dumb dumb things.
Otherwise, as Einstein said, everything is all be as simple as simple as possible as possible, as possible, it really simple.
You can can be clearly going to clearly be clearly with their science without engaging science without engaging with science.
Something to consider is how to use is use is to use is use is to use is use is to use is use is to use is use is to use is use is to use is use is to use is use is to use is use is to use is use is to use is use is to use is use is to use is use is
And when you to first introduce your work work, forget about the signs of <unk> <unk>
You know, you've been like, why they call <unk> <unk>  What do we <unk> <unk> <unk> kill them and <unk> your presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only be boring, it is far too much in the language of the language of our brain and our brain is going to come on.
Instead, this <unk> <unk> <unk> example is much more effective, you show that the special <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> is really that it really inspired the only design of the only design of the only design of the one of the only design of the only design of the only design of the only design of the only design of the only design of the only design of the
The trick here is to use a very much profound <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the audience understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide a graphics a lot more profound sense of understanding what they <unk>
I think these are only some ways that you can help the other open open our open open open door door, look at the country of the wonders that is science and science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> <unk> <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all of the <unk> <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> it means <unk> <unk> <unk>
Even though there was a <unk> <unk> 19th century described a much better time when he said, "A <unk> -- is that for a public deal with a public charge on platform, and a very beginning, and you know, get it for the mere <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the words of the words in politics, and all all the politicians know that they have to have to try the language in the language.
It's not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> British allow newspapers to quote the exact words very exact words in the <unk> camera.
And this is all thanks for the bravery with a guy in the <unk> <unk> name of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who was being <unk>
He went back into the <unk> back on the most popular support in London to <unk>
And just just a few years later, we had the first use of the <unk> sentence <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Most people think it's a literal <unk>
It isn't. It's about this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is
But to actually show you really show you really really really show you how words are words and and political <unk> Are you going back back back to the U.S., right after independence.
So, they had to have to address the question of what to call George <unk> Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How would you like to call it to the call you like to call the leader of a country <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> in Congress for a long long time.
They were all going to get all all kinds of all kinds of suggestions that might be <unk> for.
Some people wanted to call it <unk> <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> <unk> George <unk> George <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Not <unk>
Some of them just want to call it <unk>
They thought about it that it was tried to do this is that it was about it was that it was tried to do this is that it was about it was that it was tried to do this was that it was about it was tried to do this is that it was that it was about it was tried to do this was that it was about it
And not even with it they were a <unk> they had the idea that you could could be chosen the idea that you could could be chosen the idea that you could could be chosen the idea that you could could be chosen the idea that you could could be chosen the idea that you could could be chosen the idea that you could could be chosen the idea that
And there might be <unk> <unk>
All the whole world got tired <unk> <unk> because this debate <unk> <unk> <unk> for three weeks.
I read a daily <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What caused the <unk> and <unk> <unk> was the House House of Representatives was <unk> against <unk> <unk>
The House of Representatives did I didn't want to Washington Washington be <unk> out.
They didn't want to call it the King for him or his <unk> <unk>
So they wanted to give the title most title of the more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that title title was <unk> <unk>
President. I just existed before, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I had no much much much more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
There was there that there was a little <unk> <unk> of little <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but really was a trivial <unk>
And that's why the Senate is Senate caught up.
They said, "Is ridiculous, ridiculous, we can't do ridiculous, ridiculous, on!
"This guy has to sign up have to sign treated treated with <unk> <unk> <unk>
"And who would you take in serious with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of the debate, do not <unk>
We can learn to learn three very interesting stuff about all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite <unk> where I've been able to figure out, the Senate was Senate -- as was the way for the title was the title of the title of the title.
President Barack Obama is kind of is going to have enough to go to go out there, just going lucky to follow up there for the Senate in action.
The second second thing we can learning is is that when a government is going to learn about is that as a measure is <unk> --  -- will you be able to go to go for for them for <unk> for them for <unk>
But the third third thing we can can learn to -- and -- this is most important, you want to tell you, is you to is this is that the American President <unk> of the United States, the United States of the United States is not just as modest about today.
Especially if you have to have more than 5,000 people about 5,000 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 or 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and 5,000 and
The reality is reality and story about the <unk> title of <unk>
So I just won the <unk> <unk>
They got her title for <unk> <unk>
And also the other other concern of the most concern of the <unk> <unk> well -- well, this was an <unk> <unk>
But you know how many how many countries are now going to come on.
And all because they want to sound how to sound like the kind of the five 5,000 nuclear <unk> <unk> etc.
So at the last last Senate won the Senate <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> because no one is no one that is going to feel humble as humble as the president now is right now.
And I think that's the great lesson that we can can can now learn, and do with you <unk>
The politicians are trying to choice to choose and use words to shape and shape it to shape and control it, and control the reality, but really changes a lot more of the words that they could really change reality.

However, there's millions of millions of a million people in the world that are sick, sick and deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other people of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it is too much late.

And with that we can create a mouse <unk> can be able to see behind the <unk> beyond the line of the body without using X-rays, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if I take a laser take a laser <unk> switch on and focus on, you and focus it in a <unk> <unk> <unk> I would a number of <unk> to create a photons for a single millimeter size.
And that <unk> package of photons, is that we will travel to the speed of the light, light, light, and again, a million times faster than a common <unk>
So if you take that bullet bullet is <unk> and got out to take off this <unk> <unk> you disperse through this photons photons into this <unk>
What is the kind of the light of the light <unk> <unk>
Now, all of this --  --  -- remember this is all happen in less than a <unk> <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower times slower -- so you can see the light into motion.
Coca-Cola will not <unk> <unk> <unk>  -- many many things in this <unk> <unk> <unk> this information to show you what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> go on in the bottle with a photons <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Part of the light <unk> <unk> <unk> up, go at the table, and we started to look at these <unk> <unk>
A lot of many of the photons would photons get into the cap and then explode in many various directions.
As you can see, there is a air bubble bubble bubble on inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel down through the table, and because of the insights on top on the top of the <unk> you can see is on the <unk> of the bottle, the bottle, you see in the bottom of the <unk> of the bottle, the <unk> you see in the bottom of the <unk> of the bottle, the <unk> you see in the bottom of the <unk> of
Now, if you take a common bullet and <unk> and we're going to look at the same distance and look at it in a slow camera slow camera camera slow camera slow camera slow down to see that film?
One <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It would be a very boring movie <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow
And how about how about to do that we have a test is <unk> <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> <unk> off the table, of the tomato <unk>
It's like to throw a rock on a pond.
It's the way nature look like to paints a picture, it was like, to a <unk> at the time, our eyes see a <unk> composition here.
But if you look at one time this <unk> you can realize that, as the light <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why?
In the future, when this <unk> is <unk> is going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if fruit is <unk> <unk> <unk> have to have to touch it.
So what do we create this <unk> camera in the <unk>
As you know, if we took a picture at low <unk> <unk>
But we're going to go to are we going to get a billion times faster than the shortest <unk> <unk> <unk> you just get a little bit of light.
So we sent that <unk> that <unk> package of photons, -- millions of times, and we recorded it again and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> of data <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can take all the data in the raw data in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Superman can you fly.
Other heroes are able to become invisible, invisible,
And if a new power of one is a new power of a future <unk> could be able to see behind the <unk>
The idea is that we could just throw a little bit of light on the door back over the door, you could get into go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from the front way up.
where we could get to take those multiple multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's not science science, we already built built.
On the left, it's our <unk> <unk>
Behind the wall, wall there is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> light at the door.
Then of the publication of our paper in the <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction small fraction of the photons were going to go back back up, go back into the camera but slightly different different times.
And as we have a camera a camera that is fast fast, fast, our <unk> have unique capacities.
It has very good time resolution <unk> and can you look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know about the distances up to the door door, and also even the unintended things, but we don't know what point to the point that point you know what to the point that point about the point that point about the point that point about the point that point about the point that happen?
By projecting a laser <unk> a laser can record a <unk> picture on the screen, you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we're going to take a lot many images like that, tens of images, the <unk> are <unk> <unk> and try to look at the multiple <unk> <unk> of light, you can to look at the multiple <unk> <unk> of light, and we can actually see the <unk> <unk>
Can we see in <unk>
This is our reconstruction <unk>
We got things to explore before we take this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create a car to take electric cars <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or could you look for survivors in survivors in dangerous conditions looking at survivors like looking at survivors like looking for open windows out.
Or could we be able to see the interior of the body <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the same thing for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the tissue and blood -- this is really hard, so actually this is actually this is a one for the scientists that you start to think about <unk> <unk> as a new form of new visualization for <unk> <unk> <unk>
Just like <unk> <unk> <unk> myself a scientist, an art in art, an art <unk> art art.
I realized that all all of the data <unk> <unk> that we collected we collected more and are not just for scientific visualization, for scientific visualization, we can can can can we be able to we can can can we can can we can can we can see.
So create a new form of new computer shape of the computational photograph photograph photography of the computer photography, a slow camera slow motion out slow down slow down.
And look at those waves <unk> Remember, the time between each of those waves are just about <unk> <unk>
But here is also something something about fun.
If we look at the waves under the <unk> these are these us from us.
The waves were supposed to move to us.
What do happen here?
It turns out, how are we just recording almost at the speed of light, light, we have loved to see this image.
The order in events of the events in the world sometimes events in the world sometimes events in the world sometimes events in the world sometimes events in the world sometimes events in the world sometimes events in the world sometimes events in the world sometimes events in the world sometimes events in the world sometimes events in the world sometimes events in the world sometimes events in the world
We will <unk> the corresponding warping corresponding warping out of space and time, we can correct correct <unk> out.
It's time. <unk> Thank you.
Hello. This is my <unk> phone.
A mobile can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> life, you give you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, you can run by a <unk> crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile cell phone, you can a message and start a protest in in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, you would go back into <unk> and get famous.
All this is all possible for a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So let's go back back back to that time, this is town.
Here you can see what are hundreds of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of people were going to come around with a look for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. <unk> Imagine if all of these people gathered together to do is search for a change, you had a cell phone phone.
Who are you about coming out of have them guys have to come on have here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile disease, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> a Blackberry, <unk>
It's a lot of a lot of all of us have have a cell phone.
But today I talk about me about my cell phone, and how to me change my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> <unk> lines of information.
<unk>
Why is that information is this information is there?
Because in the summer of the summer summer summer summer summer summer summer summer of the E.U. ran <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive is that every single <unk> European company, European <unk> European company has to store a whole range of information information <unk>
Who is called the <unk> Who's sent an email to <unk>
Who was sent to a text text text you <unk>
And if you just use your cell phone, you -- where we are.
All this information is stored stored in is stored <unk> for at least six months of months, the two years, in his phone company or two years, in his phone company or two years, in his phone company or two years, in his phone company or two years, in his phone company or two years, in his phone company or two years, in his phone company or two years, in
And across the entire Europe people stood in, he planted and said, "We don't want to this."
They said they didn't want this data <unk> <unk> <unk> did.
We want the <unk> on the digital age digital age, we don't want to want the phone to the phone and Internet providers combined.
There was there that there was a <unk> <unk> priests, all all all guys said, "We all all all know, said, "Don't do this."
And here you can see about a number of 10,000 people who were left on the streets of the Berlin streets in the Berlin streets in the Berlin streets in the Berlin streets of the Berlin streets in the Berlin streets of the Berlin streets in the Berlin streets of the Berlin streets in the Berlin streets of the Berlin streets in the Berlin streets of the Berlin streets in
And some of you even said that this would be like this would be like this is would be <unk> <unk>
The <unk> was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I also also ask if this is really really work?
Can you store all this whole piece of information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone to a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I know that at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, of us, that for me <unk> all the whole information that you had about me.
I just asked a time, and I went back back, and ask it, and didn't get a particular answer -- it was all <unk> out.
But then I said, to have you have to have this information is because that information is because you <unk> my life. life.
So that's why I decided to give it to get a whole demand for court because I wanted to have this information information.
But <unk> <unk> <unk> don't we give you this information.
At the very end, you <unk> it on an agreement.
They will change the demand and make them the information that I have <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> <unk> failed <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> German law was the <unk> <unk> <unk>
So I got this ugly little little bit bit about brown about brown <unk>
And in the CD there was this was.
Thirty thousand dollars <unk> <unk> of information information.
And I first saw it, and I said, well, it's a big archive right. Okay.
But after a time I realized that's my life.
There is there that are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little <unk> <unk> what should I have to do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at the step the step step at the step step at the time.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it <unk>
Because I want to show you to show people what is the <unk> <unk>
So next next to <unk> <unk> <unk> Open works. City City City City City, City City, City City,  we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization for six months of my life.
You can close up and go back, out, go back back and forward.
You can see what every step I did.
And you can see what am I going to get it on in the train to <unk> <unk> and how often I call it in the way.
This is all that possible for this information.
That day a little bit scary.
But it's not just about just me.
It's about all of us.
First of all, there are one things like, -- like I call my wife -- and talk a couple of times.
And then they put me a few few friends and are called between them.
And then you call the other one, and another to the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how people communicate with each other way up to each other what time they call each other how to do you go to you sleep.
So you can see this is all do this.
You can see the centers, the leaders in the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what is going to be doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries as China as China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who you talk to who an email you email that an email an email an email an email an email an email an email an email an email an email you email that an email an email an email an email an email an email an email you email that an email an email an email
And this is information be stored at at least six months in Europe, the way to two years.
As I said to the very beginning, imagine if all all of these people in the streets in Berlin, in the <unk> fall of 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989,
And the <unk> would have known who was involved in in this protest, and if the <unk> would have known that the leaders were known as leaders as leaders, the leaders are.
The fall of the Berlin Wall <unk> perhaps never had happened.
And as a result, neither the fall <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because today, the state agencies have state agencies and businesses -- want to store so much information about we as possible as possible as possible.
They want to have the ability to go to follow our lives up and want to do it forever.
But <unk> <unk> and live in this was digital age, it's not a contradiction.
But today you have to have to have to fight for <unk> <unk>
You have to have to fight that every day.
When come home with your friends that privacy is kind about is a century value of 21st century -- and that's not very <unk> anymore.
When you go to go home, tell their representative person representative just because business and agencies to -- can store for some certain information <unk>
And if you not believe me, ask your phone company, phone company, phone company, you know, what are you <unk>
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to take care for us to remember that you have to have to fight for <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Hello, Oh! What is up? <unk>
It's not enough.
Hello, Oh! What is up? <unk>
I call myself a <unk> <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but yet, the doctor brought me in the world.

It only happens in accidents, like the one that I was thinking about.
Now, I was just going to tell you is not be a source for me not to do any one that one one of you in the room.
It feels bad for me, because at some time in life, life, you might wish to be disabled disabled.
Go ahead for a walk.

I also love if to walk my home home to New York, you like.
Many people with <unk> cerebral palsy, <unk> not <unk> but but my parents don't believe about it?
The mantra of my father was, was, "Can you get to do this -- <unk> <unk>
If I got my three <unk> biggest sisters <unk> <unk> <unk>
If I had my three <unk> older sisters were going to go to the <unk> school, my parents are going to go to the school school school system -- also out, -- and all all all the ultimate <unk> <unk>
My dad taught me to walk the age of me walk the five years of five five years of the five years to walk the <unk> on his feet and simply walking.
Another approach I was used was to was just hang out a dollar in front of me to <unk> it.
The <unk> which I took up inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in a school kindergarten was walking in a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Growing up, there was only six people in my city, and were all about the family.
Now there are now there are now there is now be 20 now, and still be all about the family's family.   -- -- I think no one is no one that we weren't <unk>
This was this before the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The people that I grew up -- have no trouble with my own trouble problems.
But I mean, I was just like <unk> a lot about a very long thing that died of hunger for the <unk>
I would tell you that I had enough fat to live three three months out to live three last three months without eating three months so -- just stop at the dawn when at at this age when he was at dawn at at this age when he was at dawn at at this age when he was at dawn at at this age when he was at dawn at

Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy. <unk> <unk>  My parents couldn't pay for physical therapy, one, that was sent to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> <unk> or whatever can I walk in <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> -- so if my friends were used to <unk> <unk>
And when my friends were going to go through summer summer summer holiday on the Jersey, <unk> I was not going.
I spent my summers up in a war zone, war, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to <unk> all all the other <unk> <unk> <unk>
On the summer summer holiday summer holiday -- summer summer college, often my father <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> me warm up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the back, I was going to go on in the <unk> <unk> I was going to go on in the <unk> <unk> I was going to go on in the <unk> <unk> I was going to go on in the
But the <unk> cure <unk> <unk> <unk> was just yoga.
I should say that it's very boring, but but but before we do yoga yoga yoga -- was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I can now now get it on in the head.
My little <unk> <unk> this idea that I could do anything about it, that no one dream was a dream was impossible, -- and my dream is to be at <unk> <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college with the university through positive <unk> positive <unk> and I get a grant a scholarship scholarship to <unk> <unk> University of the Arizona, Arizona, I was going on in all all the <unk>
It was this as the pet <unk> <unk> the theater.
And I all have all <unk> me.
I did all all the other <unk> tasks at least <unk> I got the ultimate note right into my lectures, and also also in their school classes.
Every time I was doing is a scene from the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, I was finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called called <unk> very slow <unk> <unk>
It's a piece of a piece of a girl can with brain <unk>
I was a girl with <unk> <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> <unk> I will end is a end one <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of them <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you for God <unk> <unk> I'm just a <unk> <unk>
I just didn't get the paper -- --  -- have they gave it to <unk> <unk>
I went up to <unk> running at the director of the head of the theater of the theater, the theater of the theater of the theater was theater, crying out like if someone had ever killed my cat, my cat, me ask why and she was that because they thought I could not do the speed at <unk>
And I said, <unk> <unk> if I can't do the stunts at risk, at the risk, you can't do any <unk>
It was a role for that that was literally born and have a single brain <unk>
The university was just mimicking my life. lives.
Hollywood has a Hollywood <unk> history of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> actors were not intended for a disabled papers.
And I was going to go back home, and my first <unk> tour, <unk> <unk> was as an extra as an extra <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew what would be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> friend friend <unk> <unk> <unk>
Instead, he went up there as a <unk> it was not going to just be more than <unk> it and was obvious for me that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They only get to give it to perfect people.
But there was the exceptions to the rule.
I grew up up to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all all these women had one thing in in common: they were <unk>
So that's why I was <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in my first <unk> tour, he led by comics comics in front cases from New York City at New Jersey, and never forget the first side of the first side of the first comedian of the first score that was the first comedian was the first comedian of first comedian is the first comedian is the first comedian is the first comedian is the first comedian is the first
I worked in all the United United States, in the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> first <unk> <unk>
I never really like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little little rumor little little rumor is says that the women are not kind of fun -- and find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother brother of another a new mother and father, Dean <unk> <unk> -- and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> New New York <unk>
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and time remind the <unk> directors that <unk> <unk> and Arab <unk>
<unk> the Arab Arabs was much easier to fight the challenge of challenge the challenge for stigma for disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was just as invited by the news news news news news search news program back up with Keith <unk>
I walked as if we were going to a graduate school graduate school, I went back into a study and sat at a <unk> wheelchair.
I looked at the head back, and said, <unk> <unk> you can give another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four three, <unk>
And we were in <unk> <unk>
So I was clinging on on the desk from the host way we would go out inside the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was going to come on. out.
Eventually, I had my opportunity and <unk> <unk> I knew not they going to have having me. to me.
But not just just just just like Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it was just like <unk> full time <unk> full time <unk> full time to <unk> <unk>
Something of fun things that I learned in live online with Keith <unk> Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet is <unk>
The kids is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
All of a sudden, my online disability on the Internet became <unk> <unk>
I would watch online clips on line online with comments -- like, "Why are you <unk> for?
"It's <unk> <unk>
And my favorite one: <unk> <unk> <unk>
What is the point?
We should really be praying at the <unk> <unk>
A <unk> suggested to even add my disability for my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
disability is as visual here as visual like race.
If someone in the wheelchair you can do is <unk> do about <unk> it, you can can't do with someone do any of you have to do with somebody do with somebody do any of you have to do with somebody do any of you have to do with somebody do any of you have to do with somebody do any of you have to do with somebody do any
<unk> are the -- yes. man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The doctors were told not to be <unk> at, but I'm here in front of you.
However, we had to have been growing up with grown up with the media media, I don't think about it?
I hope that together we can create a lot more positive pictures of disability in disability disability in the media and and everyday lives.
Maybe if there were more accurate images, that -- less hate to the Internet.
Or maybe we not.
We probably need to do is we use all the whole whole whole society is to actually teach our children.
My bionic <unk> has led me into very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> the red <unk> red carpet by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film in a film with Adam <unk> Adam <unk> <unk> and work with the incredible Dave <unk> incredible Dave
<unk> The Arab <unk> <unk> have <unk> <unk>
I was a <unk> <unk> on the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> <unk>
And he founded <unk> <unk> <unk> a charity is going to give children Syrian Palestinians very tiniest part of what my parents would <unk> me.
It was the only time my father saw me acting in live, and do is this talk talk to your memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call it a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and if I can, can, you can too. too.
I'd like to tell a story about a little story about a child in a small town.
I don't know, name it, your story.
He lives in a small village to <unk> <unk>
This is people about <unk> <unk>
<unk> drives the small village to poverty <unk> <unk>
Without anything for him there, go to the great city, in this case, <unk> <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there is no any chance -- have no work -- no job for any future.
He was just living in a <unk> in the city outside the <unk>
After maybe one year <unk> <unk> <unk> nothing.
A day one day a day is a guy who offers you to <unk> it to <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were going to go into a dynamic group of dynamic people, that day a break.
She gets a little bit bit of money for you to bought themselves, new clothes new, money to send them home to their family.
He's presented with a young young young boy.
They finally noticed the house.
It begins a new life. new life.
It has a goal for life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky sky, the blue sky <unk> <unk> <unk> a car bomb.
That little boy from that little kid with that small village with the big city, I was looking at the great city, the great city was the great city, was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> -- a <unk> terrorist organization connected to the Qaeda.
So, how is the story of a little boy in a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end up with him <unk>
He was waiting for.
I was just waiting for an opportunity to start to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first one that he came next. out. out.
This was the first thing that he took out of what we called "the <unk> <unk>
And his story is all about in urban city centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For the young people, the <unk> great American dream of city is the opportunity to opportunity, of work, work, well-being, well-being, well, the young people are not engaged in the way in in the prosperity in their cities.
It's often the youth that of the highest rates of the <unk> <unk>
By 2030, three of every five five of five five five people living in cities be under 18 years.
If we were not providing with young people in the young people in the young people in our cities in our cities, in our cities, are our cities if we were to tell you, opportunities for the history of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> will be the story of cities history that cities happen.
And in my city <unk> <unk> <unk> 70 percent of the young people is <unk> out.
70 percent of not work, not go back at school.
They do not do anything at pretty much nothing.
I went back back up to <unk> last month, and went back to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember standing in front of that hospital <unk> <unk> <unk> you thinking, thinking, and what do I ever gone?
And if I had to forced me to be in the same time <unk> <unk> <unk>
It would have become a <unk> <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> <unk> that month was actually to have to harbor a whole bunch of these young leaders in a business edge.
I was going to go back to the early '90s 90 people <unk> <unk> <unk>
We sat down and got out to have it is we all all and have we got a <unk> about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk> <unk>
He went up at the University of <unk> <unk> <unk>
There was no job job, and not opportunities.

They were looking for people to like him.
But this is story that story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to reach of the point A point point A to point A to point A to point A to point A to point A to point A to point A to point A to point A to point A to point A to point A to point A to point A to point A to point A to point A to point A to point
<unk> years of civil war have was completely destroyed completely <unk> the traffic system around, completely <unk> a <unk> way easier to <unk>
<unk> saw a opportunity and <unk> <unk>
It began a <unk> <unk> company.
He began <unk> <unk> up to the local residents of the local residents who were normally normally supposed to <unk> anymore.
I bought 10 <unk> with her help of his family and friends, friends, and his dream is at some point now we expand for hundreds of muscles for the next three years.
Why is this is different about that story?
What do you do about to this other story is different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new chance.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think that the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people be the creators of the economic opportunities for economic opportunities that they are looking for so much.
And you can train the people train the young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to tell you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was going to train to train some people at the height of young people at the height of the young people at the height of the young people at the height of the young people at the height of the young people at the height of the young people in the height of the young people at the height of the young people at the height of the young
In fact, this is the first <unk> <unk> <unk> have seen in over over 22 years, and until recently, he went on, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> <unk> we were from a plastic <unk>
If you ask with somebody, somebody, "When was the last time you saw <unk> <unk>
For those of us who were growing during during the civil war, the answer is: do you know about it?
So Mohamed saw a chance. opportunity.
It began a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I created a set up in the outskirts of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that as he was like, -- could they survive the hard for <unk> <unk>
And he began the flowers in flowers in the houses, and business companies in the city, and now are working on in creating the <unk> first first public park of first first public park in first of first of the first public <unk> <unk>
There's no public parks in <unk> <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, young families, you can go together, -- and, like he says, smell the <unk> <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow <unk> pink <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the first step is to is inspire the young people, and in that room, the Muhammad Mohamed had a really profound impact on very profound impact.
They were never thought about starting to start a <unk>
They had to have to work in work in work for a <unk> working for the government, but their story, what it really is, really has a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city city city as a place place place.
They encouraged me to believe that they could could be the entrepreneurs, that might be <unk> change in change.
By the end of the day, the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, I will actually inspire young people people and create a culture culture in the corporate spirit culture is really quite a big way, but -- but young people need to have capital capital to do their own reality.
They need experience experience and orientation <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people with the people with the resources that they need to need to happen to move away from conception of the understanding of the conception of creation, to bias that bias to the understanding is understanding about conception of to conception of creation, and create the <unk>
For me, the business spirit corporate spirit, corporate spirit, the corporate spirit is something more to start a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed It's just just selling by selling flowers.
I think it's actually selling hope.
This is how they call it when it is called, -- is how it's called, -- will transform the way that people can see their city.
<unk> I hired children from the street to help rent to rent and hold on to <unk>
He gave them the opportunity opportunity to escape from the <unk> <unk> <unk>
These young people are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn young people in the entrepreneurs, we were going to <unk> <unk> their innovation <unk> <unk> more stories about flowers and <unk> stories about flowers and <unk> stories about flowers and <unk> stories about flowers and <unk> stories about flowers and <unk> stories about flowers and <unk> stories about flowers and <unk> stories about flowers and <unk> stories about flowers and <unk> stories about flowers
Thank you.
I was just going to <unk> my father at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun was making the <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and not just be the way for the way that we can <unk> we can almost almost pretend that we are just the first human ones to on step on the way.
We went back to our camp.
It was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> beautiful <unk> <unk> when I discovered something happened.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk> incredibly angry.
The <unk> who were too much too lazy too lazy lazy as lazy lazy they <unk> was going to <unk> out.
That question followed with me, is me and get it a little bit.
Who else is <unk> <unk> <unk>
No matter how to <unk> <unk> or where do you like to do -- know what do you like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Who is clean in in Rio <unk> <unk>
Here I in New York, you in New York, the New York, the <unk> <unk> clean <unk> <unk> our trash is right from 11 tons of tons of tons of a whole day day.
I wanted to know that as a individuals.
I wanted to understand what do do that that is do that that do that that is do.
What do you like to use the uniform is to use the uniform for?
So I started a research project with research project.
I traveled down in the trucks and walked down down the way forward, and interview people in office and facilities around the city, and learned a lot, but still was a <unk> one.
I needed a little way more to a lot more.
So I started to work as a trash <unk>
Now I just not just just travel traveling in in travel in traveling out traveling out in travel traveling in in the trucks. Now I was <unk> <unk>
And I was going to go on with little <unk> <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning thing.
They all all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not much as prevailing as you believe in, and in day it is very strong you <unk> very much.
It costs a lot to hard use for weight.
I met people who had been working on in it for many many years, their bodies were still <unk> <unk> the weight to take over its entire DNA tons tons of weeks.
It's also the <unk>
According to the Bureau of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the top 10 <unk> more dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned for reason.
You're out going out and entering the traffic every day and <unk> around you.
They just want to <unk> it -- is that general <unk> are driver being paying attention. up.
That's really bad for <unk> <unk>
And also the trash itself is full from dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of dangers of
I also learned about <unk> <unk> <unk>
When you go out of the <unk> you and you see a city from the back back city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is kind about as a force of nature itself.
She never stop to come.
It's also like a kind of a kind of a kind of a breath or breathing or breathing way.
It's always going to be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that the stigma is is particularly ironic that the waste <unk> are waste are more important in the most important work of the most important work of the most important work of the most important work of the most important work of the most important work of the most important work of the most important work of the most important work in the city streets of
These are the first protective <unk> first protective <unk>
If you don't get rid of the waste of the waste efficient and effective way efficient and effective way <unk> <unk> of their <unk> and their <unk> risks very real very real ways.
We were controlled by for decades and centuries come back to come back to <unk>
The economy needs them.
If we can not get rid with the old old we don't have space room for new -- so the animal engines are in the economy begin to fail when are the consumption in consumption of use.
I'm not advocating about capitalism, capitalism, I just put in their relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed that day we need.
And I mean, just just be just at the speed that we can used to move to move in the contemporary time.
We don't we not care about us, are no <unk> <unk> <unk> up our own coffee cup of our coffee cup -- our coffee cup -- our coffee cup -- -- our coffee cup -- -- our coffee cup -- -- our coffee cup -- our coffee cup -- -- our coffee cup -- -- our coffee cup -- -- our coffee cup -- -- our coffee cup -- our
We used to them them, we are all about them, because we know that there is a work force of work on the other side that it was asked about it.
So today I would to suggest you a couple of ways to think about the waste waste of waste waste waste that maybe help you reduce the stigma stigma is <unk> and reduce the conversation about how to design is to design a sustainable city sustainable and be designing about how to design a city sustainable and design is to design a sustainable city sustainable and have to design a
Her work, I think, is almost <unk> <unk>
They're in the street every day every day.
They use a uniform in a lot of cities.
Do you know when to do it be?
And their work work up to us do our own.
They're almost a kind of a way of relief.
The flow that keep us with us except of our own <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> and that flow is always to stay one way or another.
One day after September 11 of the <unk> September 11, 2001, I heard a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> truck in the street the street the road, I got my little little little little <unk> and down the stairs <unk> and down the stairs running down down the stairs running down down the stairs <unk> and I went down on the stairs down down the stairs running down the
And I tried to thank him to do his work work that particular day in particular -- but I started to cry.
And I looked at me and just <unk> <unk> and said, "We're going to go right right.
We're going to go right to be right."
Shortly after that, I started to research through research collection and research and look at that man.
It's called <unk> <unk> we worked together a lot of times and made us very good friends.
I want to believe you <unk> <unk> was right.
We're going to go right to be good.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on on this planet as species we should have to have to have all the cost -- even cost the costs, even the very real cost of very real cost of very real cost of cost of the costs, even the very real cost of very real cost of very real cost of real cost of costs the costs, even
The city <unk> the city the city the city is thinking about when we talk about trash -- represent three percent of the total waste waste waste waste is.
It's a remarkable <unk> <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives lives, life, the next thing to work is how to work this work is to get you a moment to <unk>
I will just take a moment to tell you -- thank you.
My work is focused on the connection that way of our communal life life being part of the environment environment where architecture is born naturally of the conditions and local traditions.
I brought two last two recent projects of recent projects I brought two recent projects such as example of this. of this.
Both of projects are sitting in in the emerging countries in emerging countries, one in Tunisia.
They will share the fact that different analysis is different analysis from different perspectives forms into an essential part of the end piece of architecture.
The first example started with an an invitation to design a whole number <unk> center of many stories in Ethiopia, that Addis Addis <unk> <unk>
This is the kind of kind of us like to show us as a example, my team and me about what we had to design.
At the very beginning, the first thing I thought was, was, is, what did I want to get out to get out of the <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings in the city, we realized that there are three important things to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are nearly empty -- because they have very large stores in which people can't not afford to buy it.
Second, you need to make much much much much much lot of energy on because of the amount of energy much energy because of the amount of energy much energy because of the amount of energy much energy because of the amount of energy much more energy because of the amount of energy much energy because the <unk> <unk> It takes heat heat up into the interior, so that we
In a city a city that this is not going to be going to happen because of a climate where we are a weather in where we is a very long weather that goes 20 to 25 to 25 to the entire year. year.
And third of all, its looks like is it not have anything to do with Africa with Africa not with Ethiopia.
It's a good place for a place that rich in a way rich in a culture and traditions.
In our first visit of Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia, is.
There is also that that idea is to use public space to generate the external <unk>
So I thought, that was what really wanted to design, design is design, design, not a commercial <unk>
But the question was how to build a great <unk> building, of several stories of stories by applying these principles.
The next challenge next challenge was going to to survey the site, the area of a much much growing area of a lot of a lot of much growth in a lot of much growth of the city, a lot of much growth in the city, a lot of much growth in the city, a lot of much growth in the city, a lot of much growth of the city
And it's also between two of two of these parallel streets streets out not going to communicate on for a hundred thousand feet. feet.
So the first thing we did was to do is create a connection of the connection between these two streets streets, putting all the <unk> out of the building.
And this is spread out with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> create a space to the air open air open air <unk> <unk> <unk> for its own form, the sun <unk>
And around this space we've applied to the point of the market idea of market <unk> small businesses, small businesses, change on each other because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close to the building the building?
I wanted to find a solution to <unk> to the local conditions.
And I started to think about a tissue similar to a concrete <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to allow the air, air input the air, it is also a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired in these beautiful <unk> of the dresses <unk>
They have a properties of the fractal geometry fractal geometry fractal coarse-scale geometry, fractal geometry. <unk> <unk> really helped me to model the <unk>
We are building that with these little little <unk> <unk> pieces that are the windows that left to move through the air and light air into the air and open air into the air and open air into way inside the building.
This is kind of with these little little little colors of colors that the inside of the inside of the building was inside the way of the building was building inside the way of the building was building inside the way of the building was building inside the way the way of the building building inside the way of the building was building inside the way the way of the
And with these ideas it very easy to convince developers developers because of the developers -- thought, this is not a commercial center a commercial <unk> <unk> <unk>
But ultimately, we all all all have found out that this idea of the market was going to realize that this is idea that this idea of the market was going to realized that this is idea that this idea of the market was going to realized that this is idea that this idea of the market was going to realized that this is idea that this idea of the
And then the idea of the facade of the facade of the facade of the facade of the facade that was much much more economic -- much because of the material you because of the material compared to the material compared to the material compared to the material compared to the material compared to the glass -- with glass, but also because we had to have to have to have
So we can get to get the way savings up in the budget that we used to have to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to make the energy power <unk> for the building in a city where the electricity is cut down almost every day.
So we got to get a big advantage putting up in the <unk>
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with meeting and a meeting different <unk> areas and meeting and <unk> <unk>
And these are them going on on the roof, that we have all been collected water down for the inside.
It's expected for the early early early time the next year, the next year, we were going to go through the fifth floor <unk>
The second example is a <unk> <unk> master <unk> of 2,000 apartments apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project that big, big project, the bigger than I ever designed, long, I need to not only understand the city the city the Tunisia, Tunisia, to the city of Tunisia of the city the city of the Tunisia, Tunisia -- but need not to understand the city the city of the Tunisia, Tunisia -- but need not to understand the city the city of the Tunisia,
During that analysis <unk> I got special attention in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to do was it is expand the existing streets up, it is creating 12 early blocks similar to size and the features there are there in Barcelona and other <unk> <unk>
In addition to that, we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select we select select some of some of these things <unk> are <unk> in relation to the idea of
And the last operation was to think about the cell is to think about the cell, the small cell on the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in <unk> <unk>
And it's a <unk> <unk> it creates a difference a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and as much natural ventilation.
So I would a <unk> a framework that claims that most of those apartments are apartments are perfectly <unk> <unk>
And this is the result is almost like a combination of the combination of the previous previous block, European block is <unk> and almost like a combination of the <unk> European block is <unk> and almost like a combination of the <unk> European block is <unk> and the Arab city town.
It has these blocks with together with the <unk> <unk> and then in the lower <unk> we got all the connections to each other.
And it also respond to the local rules in local standards local rules that they can have a greater density in higher levels and higher levels and higher levels and lower levels of the <unk>
And it also <unk> this whole idea of the doors.
The roof, that's my favorite space in my project is almost like giving to bring to the community the community full by the construction.
It's where all the neighbors is where all the neighbors is where all the neighbors is where all the neighbors is where all the neighbors is where all the neighbors is where all the neighbors is where all the neighbors is where all the neighbors is where all the neighbors is where all the neighbors is where all the neighbors is where all the neighbors is where all the neighbors
These two examples, they have a common approach in design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries where you can see are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in architecture in the life of people changes the communities and local economies and local economies in the local communities and local economies at the same pace that the buildings grew up.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking at simple solutions, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the relationship between the community the way between the community and the community is between the community and the community between the community and be able to improve the relationship between community and community and environment is to connect
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. <unk> It was so <unk> as you see all all the new girls.
He had great amounts of very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I ended up that year and I was just filled with <unk> <unk> until I was going to get my sinister thinking.
And I was a day one day after I coming out to the school back out of the school, and I hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> <unk> salt, I go in into the lectures, classes, lectures, I took out on the table of my teacher <unk> <unk>
And then, I did.
I was going to look at the ratings care cards -- just a little bit, just just like this.
All the way --  -- and I have a book back into the <unk> but -- see, some of my other other colleagues had very good notes too.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes all around the world, without imagination.
I put up all all of the <unk> from <unk> <unk> and I'm just going to just be there, because they <unk>
I'm still surprising to me what I did.
I don't just understand how the idea came from.
I don't really understand why do I feel about why I felt good for me.
I felt a big deal.
I don't really understand why have I never <unk> me.
It was all all very obvious that everything was obvious <unk>
I will never <unk> me.
But above all, I was going to tell me the reason why I was afraid that this little little bit small, to <unk>
Would I love jealousy. them?
They're so mysterious as mysterious as mysterious <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
And also the primates. <unk> are also very <unk>
We know the <unk> are the number one one <unk> <unk> <unk>
And yet, I have never seen a study of study a study of study at the time you can, or the long length duration or duration duration or <unk> <unk>
So we have to have to go to fiction, fiction, because the novels are like the <unk> <unk> in all of their possible ways.
In fact, I don't even know if it's a exaggeration to the exaggeration -- say that if there was no <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I would not have a <unk> <unk> <unk> would not <unk>
There would you have the have king <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
There would I have no Shakespeare.
We were going to get the lists in high school reading, because we would be missing the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> There's no <unk> <unk> I know it's not going to say that we got the answers for everything, and in the <unk> you all got all about.
This year is 100 year a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all what we could have. <unk> Right?
We think about a child trying to <unk> <unk>
We think about a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were just forget about how hard is hard to go.
We are forget about <unk> <unk> <unk>
I mean, it's about books in books books that Virginia <unk> <unk> said was that hard as a cat <unk>
I don't know how do you mean what do you mean is how do you mean what are the coffee <unk> <unk> but but we assume it's <unk> <unk>
Let's look at why are they going so good together, the novel and <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the person person, to your person, desire, to their <unk> <unk> are a good storytelling base.
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we felt about jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves of ourselves one story.
A story about life lives in other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make make us feel a sense wrong.
Being in the <unk> and audience -- know exactly exactly what details about you to <unk> to <unk> the knife <unk> to <unk> the knife <unk> to <unk> the knife <unk>
<unk> make us make all novelists like <unk> <unk> -- and that's something that I would understand.
Everything that she does is me to make me me for pleasure to the other time.
And it starts to say it is the same thing that story, and so -- -- says that every <unk> cool cool thing that <unk> you <unk> -- on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You must admit that <unk> <unk> and <unk> be <unk> <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> you have to have to leave the country, if you wanted to break to break up with it.

We're going to go back to look for <unk> women.
No. I think I think it's going to say that the <unk> would <unk> us reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion of other excitement that is going to get us with me with this is that particular <unk>
There's one other emotion of other emotion -- is going to take our <unk> our awful <unk> <unk> <unk>
Any other other emotion of other emotion is going to show us to look with that <unk>

Freud says the man was going to be on the <unk> <unk> of your unconscious <unk>
<unk> are very good at this.

In fact, the more intensely <unk> <unk> we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we

So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure when they're not sure when they're not sure when they're not sure when they're not sure when they're not sure when they're not sure when they're not sure when they're not sure when they're not sure when they're not sure when they're not sure when they're not sure when they're not sure when they're not
Let's go to the <unk> <unk> Street and Street ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the atomic <unk> <unk> <unk> Professor <unk> that criminal genius <unk>
But I've always even <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chief head of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you need the <unk> <unk> <unk> need the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Oh, I was so <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> needs your help, but you can get it up with <unk> <unk> in each other of those kinds of those kinds of those kinds of those kinds of those kinds of those kinds of those kinds of those kinds of those kinds of those kinds of those kinds of those kinds of those kinds of those kinds of those kinds of those kinds of those kinds of some of
But as they work together, something is something that it starts to change, change, change, change, change, change, and finally it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all all of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're just proud to <unk>
And he says there is no one person in <unk> <unk> you just not like to <unk> your hand.
It's one one of the times a few times as we saw <unk> <unk> it is this very emotional -- that is really emotional <unk> right?
It seems to try the <unk> as a problem of geometry, is no without emotion.
You know, in a second <unk> <unk> is the opposite side side of the <unk> <unk>
The next minute of the next one is the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> <unk> be to admire this idea of being <unk> <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if you <unk> them are really kind of a question of geometry, a matter where we allowed us to be in relationship with each other?
Well, maybe we don't have to have have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have
We can <unk> it with it.
But I like <unk> <unk> plans.
So while as we hope that happens, we remember now that we have fiction for <unk>
This is only <unk> <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used to the <unk> invites the table.
And look at what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the crazy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in a great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve great problems.
On the 21st <unk> of July of course of the July, Buzz worms, Buzz Aldrin jumped out outside the Apollo outside of the Apollo Apollo of Apollo Apollo 11 11 of the Apollo <unk> <unk>
Armstrong went out, they were alone, themselves, themselves, but their presence on the <unk> surface of the Earth was in the entire surface surface of the Earth was in the entire surface surface of the Earth was in the entire surface surface of the Earth was in the entire surface surface of the Earth was in the entire surface surface of the Earth was in the entire surface surface of
The Apollo program program program program program program program program program program program program.
To get the way to the moon, last NASA was spent about 180 a billion dollars about 180 <unk> billion dollars of people today, -- or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo Apollo work work at about 400,000 people and asked <unk> <unk> <unk> businesses, universities and government agencies.
People were people -- including the crew Apollo from Apollo Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program program program program program program program program program program program program program program program program program program program program program program program program program Apollo <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked above the surface, of which women were, behind the death <unk> last year, is the most <unk>
So why are we <unk>
They didn't have a lot about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> were old -- -- -- a new sense of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why <unk> <unk> The cynical answer is cynical answer is that it was because the President Kennedy Kennedy wanted to demonstrate about <unk> <unk>
But in the top words of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> us have a better idea.
John <unk> Some people ask, ask the <unk>
Why is it turn it the turn turn it in our goal?
And you could also ask, why is scale the mountain more <unk>
35 years ago, why do you fly about to fly about the <unk>
Why is it play with a <unk> Rice <unk> Rice <unk>
We chose to go to go to the moon.
We chose to go to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon over in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was only just a West in West West West -- on the course of the Cold War.
At the time, the most strong emotion was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They went because it was a great thing to do that.
The Moon came up in a <unk> context of a long long list of a long list of a long list of a long list of a long list list of a long list list of a long list list list.

Since of the 1970s, no human being human being being <unk> ever been going to come back.
Nobody has traveled faster than went to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to have problems that technology is problems that we imagined that technology would problem is problems that we imagined that technology would problem is problems that we imagined that technology would problem is problems that we imagined that technology would problem is problems that we imagined that technology
I remember to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me not going to <unk> on the <unk> escape <unk> <unk> rocket.
I knew what, this is the last mission <unk> last mission, but I was just going to come to see the colonies on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on
So that of you mean what happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it has a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard about it for the last two days here at TED.
It looks like what if the technologists would have found themselves <unk> and have trivial, like <unk> <unk> <unk> and political <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
There's nothing bad at most majority of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives. lives.
But don't we have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in the Silicon Silicon Silicon Valley Silicon Silicon Valley, Silicon Silicon Valley Silicon Silicon Valley, Silicon Silicon Valley Silicon Silicon Valley Silicon Silicon Valley Silicon Silicon Valley Silicon Silicon Valley Silicon Silicon Valley Silicon Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley, that we have have been created to have less ambitious companies <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley is that markets are <unk> <unk> <unk> -- the incentives that venture capitalists are VCs at risk venture capitalists lead the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk <unk> caused us to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to <unk> <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think that is this explanation is good enough.
It is mostly going wrong wrong with <unk> <unk> <unk>
Even when the risk capitalists were kids were at risk were at the very high point for risk, you care for the risk, they make small investments, small investments, little investments, small investments, you want to go out in 10 years.
The <unk> have always have been problems about to invest with benefit them in technologies technologies as energy as energy, that you need to need a huge capital <unk> <unk> have been invested in the development technologies because to solve great problems because they have no commercial <unk> <unk>
No, the reasons we can't can't solve the big problems that big problems we can't solve solve the big problems that big problems we can't solve solve the big problems that big problems we can't solve solve the big problems that big problems we can't solve solve the big problems that big problems we can't solve solve the big problems that big problems we can't solve solve the big problems
Sometimes, we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to the Mars <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to the Mars would require a political decision decision to popular, and that's that never happen.
We are not going to go to the Mars because of the world think that there are more important things that to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because of the big problems because of the big problems because of the big problems because of the big problems because of the big problems because of the big problems because of the big problems because of the big problems because of the big problems because of the big problems because of the big problems because of the big problems because of the
Today, less about two percent of the global energy consumption of the global energy energy is coming out of sources of energy sources of renewable energy sources of renewable energy sources of renewable energy as solar as solar -- wind and <unk> <unk> <unk> about two percent, and the reason is it's completely cheap.
Carbon and natural gas is natural gas is cheaper to wind solar power and wind, oil is cheaper to <unk>
We want to want to want a sources of alternative sources of alternate energy sources of alternatives sources of alternate sources of alternate sources of alternate sources of alternate sources of alternate sources of alternate sources of alternate sources of alternate sources of alternate sources of alternate sources of alternate sources of alternate sources of alternate sources of alternate sources of alternate sources of alternate sources of alternate sources of
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about how policy policies and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> increase in significant increase in a significant rise rise in a significant rise rise into research and development and energy development, and some of control control of the price of price of the price of price of price of the price of price of the price of price of the price of price
But there's no hope in the current political climate of us that we're going to see is that we see is a look at an American energy policy U.S. America or America or international America is that we reflect consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems they were just like technical around, just come to come on.
We know for long for a long time that famines is been a result a result of failure is a result of failure of failure in failure in the food <unk>
But 30 years of the research have been taught that famines are massive the political crisis that they affect <unk> <unk> <unk> food distribution.
Technology can be able to be able to be able to improve better things like the yields of us or waste storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage for storage
And finally, the big problems sometimes <unk> <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem problem.
President Nixon declared war war stated out there there are many many many different types of cancer, some terribly resistant to the treatment 10 years seem to have have found effective and effective and effective and effective treatments and effective effective treatments and effective or effective effective treatments and effective and effective treatments and effective and effective and effective and effective treatments and effective and effective and effective and effective
The hard problems are difficult are hard for.
It's not true that we could not solve problems with problems with problems.
We can and do is we have the problem -- problem, the problem, the institutions should you want to solve the problem, the problem, the problem, the people have to solve the problem, the problem, the problem, the people have to solve the problem, the problem, the problem, the people have to solve the problem, the problem, the problem, the people have to solve the problem, the problem, the problem
The <unk> mission is <unk> that has become kind of as much as a metaphor for the technology technology to solve the technology to solve great problems, it happen with these <unk> <unk>
But it's a <unk> model <unk> in the future.
We're not in <unk> <unk>
There's no great science mythology like to explore the solar system.
In general, you go to the moon the moon very simple, simple. <unk>
It was a only three days.
And actually, I was not even going to have any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future the future the future you can get. out.
And God know we are not bad about the challenges.
Thank you very much.
OK, I'm just going to talk about trust, about trust, the trust, and start -- to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ideas -- that you have about trust.
They're so common that they have become become <unk> in terms of our society.
I think that's three.
The first one is a <unk> there have been a great big decrease in trust, trust, is a very widespread <unk>
The second one is a <unk> <unk> we should have more more trust.
And the third third is a <unk> we should have to bring the trust.
I think the <unk> the target and <unk> have <unk> <unk> out.
So what I'm going to try to tell you is tell you is tell you is tell you today is a really tell you today is a really tell today is a different story about a <unk> one <unk> a goal and a goal and a task -- that I think gives you a much more clear idea of idea the most clear idea about the subject.
First <unk> <unk> people think that trust is <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own single <unk> one I doesn't think about the answer.
It will just turn it to think that it can have have come down down come down into some other activities or institutions, or institutions or institutions, and could have it even increase in others.
I don't have a clear thing.
But I can just turn up to surveys of opinion, and opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of the belief that the confidence is going to come about.
When you look at actual surveys over the time, time, there's many many many many different evidence.
I mean, the people that you were going to come up in, do 20 years ago, mostly journalists and political and political <unk> still know the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years 20 years of still be pretty <unk> dead -- judges, the political <unk>
The rest are there in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen is the street is almost exactly about half the way.
But is this is this evidence is enough?
What shows you <unk> record are people record are, are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What are you looking at are the <unk> attitudes really look at are the <unk> attitudes <unk> <unk> when you guys do certain questions.
<unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now, if someone would tell you, are you <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> on the <unk> teachers.
You would probably be able to be asking by the question, you do what?"
And that would be a very big answer to <unk> <unk>
And you could say, when you've said to you when your question, you say, <unk> -- your question, you say, trust you, in some other one, you no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to place a <unk> <unk>
We don't assume the level of the confidence that we are going to feel for a certain kind of a little <unk> <unk> a person person, is going to be uniform at each other.
I could, for example, that I trust you in a certain master school master <unk> I know about to give in the class class class, I know to give in the class class class, I know about to give the audience class class, I know about to give the audience class class, I know about to give the audience class class, I know about to give the audience class class,
After all, I could know that that was not good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but not to keep a conversation, a secret.
Simple.
And if we had those evidence evidence in our everyday lives in our everyday trust that trust is <unk> -- why we leave all of all that knowledge is when we think of all the knowledge when we think about trust yourself in the <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad to measure the real level of real trust level of real trust, because they're trying to <unk> the good trial in fact to trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what happens to the second one, the first thing about with the <unk>
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a target stupid.
It's not that the goal that I was going to do.
I will encourage you to have more people more confidence in the way that is <unk> of trust, trust, that of us not what it is.
Ultimately, I am a <unk> <unk> not trust what it's not reliable.
And I think those people were going to bring their savings very much like called Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I think about them, I think about them, and think about them, I think about them, and think about them, I think about them, and think about them, I think about them, and think about them, I think about them, and think about them, I think about them, and
Having more trust is not a smart target for this life.
<unk> or <unk> <unk> that is the right one.
Once you can tell it that he says, you know, say, -- -- that mean that what matter first is really important in first place is first that is first time is first that is first place is trust, that is first place is trust, but do is each other <unk>
And that's what it's about making a judgment of a trial about how reliable people are in in certain ways.
And I think that is that we can to do a way we can do is a way of a trial, are we forced to focus on focus on three things.
They are <unk> they're <unk> -- are <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if we found a person to a person is competent in the way -- is responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trust in it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on on the other hand, they're not why we couldn't could not tolerate we cannot trust them.
I have a friends for friends who are really <unk> and honest and honest -- -- in them to take a letter to the <unk> <unk>
I have a friends who are really sure that they can do certain things about things, but what I see that we would a <unk> <unk>
And I'm a very good joy to say that I think I don't many many friends that are a lot of friends that be <unk> and responsible and responsible for.
If I was still not <unk> me.
But that's what we're going to get up to do -- right now.
Hope is the trust is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last decades, we have tried to build systems out of build systems out of the form systems of people professional institutions, professional institutions, people -- and all make us be easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk> <unk>
And I remember once he was talking about with a <unk> and said, "Well, you know, see the problem is that it takes more time to make the animal <unk> <unk> more time is going to take more time to make the administrative <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And we found the same problem in whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole thing is all about our public life, our public lives, we will recognize that the system that accountability system is meant going to make sure is that we do the opposite.
What are you doing is <unk> <unk> do are the work of people people have to do hard work, like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can all all know that you can all know about the same way.
It will all get all that for the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and be <unk> more to the things that things would be different if we were going to be afraid of the confidence of trust and trust -- to the people that are people that we are good and if you to determine whether to determine whether other people to determine whether other people to determine if other people.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- -- bad things -- -- what doesn't you <unk> properly.
Third, the task.
We were going to look at the task to reconstruct the confidence, trust, puts things the way around.
It suggests that it suggests that you and I should be able to rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can actually reconstruct a little little bit bit of the trustworthiness.
We can do that if you're two people, together, trying to improve better.
But trust, the trust, <unk> is signature the way the signature because we give you very many four other people.
You can't really reconstruct what other people have given has ever <unk> here.
You have to give the bases enough to you can can be trust you.
You have to have to have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, it's that that is because that is because of you <unk> for you for all about -- all all the people people, all all the time.
But you also also have to need a <unk> evidence that you are worthy of trust.
How do do we do that?
That gets a day, everywhere, everywhere, do people common people -- -- the <unk> the <unk> really effectively.
I'll give a simple simple commercial example.
The store where I bought my socks <unk> <unk> says that I can <unk> <unk> <unk>
I take them up and get away the money, or do it change them for the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they actually got vulnerable to me.
I think there is a big lesson on that.
If you get vulnerable vulnerable to the other hand, you very much good proof of trust and trust you saying.
So in the end, I think what we're going to are pointing at is really be very difficult to <unk>
What are people rely on in the relationships, and relationships, and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the early early early beings of the computers have computers have come to take away with us how to reduce the separation to the <unk> of the digital data, the separation between our world world and the world that the imagination can <unk> <unk>
This separation has been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and
But I ask the other question, and if there was no <unk>
I started to figure out how to <unk>
First I first created this tool that a tool that goes away in, in the digital space, so when the strong <unk> were <unk> it strong against the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Designers can <unk> <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, 3D, 3D, surgeons can practice with virtual organs the screen.
So with this tool you break off. down.
But the two hands remain out of the outside of the screen.
How do you want to get inside the way inside and interact with digital information using the whole <unk> of your hands? out on the <unk>
In the division of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Microsoft, along with my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> little space on the keyboard on in a computer <unk>
It will one <unk> a <unk> <unk> have a profound depth of depth in depth of the fingers and face, you now to raise the hands from the keyboard, you can reach the way into the 3D space, and grab these pixels straight down. out.
Like the windows and archives have a place in real space, <unk> <unk> it's just as easy as to grab a book book.
You can just flip through the book book and highlight lines or words with the virtual touch touch sensor in the virtual <unk> <unk> <unk>
The architects can spread out or rotate your models directly with hands.
In these examples, us <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest in the papers and making the digital information come to us?
We were just going to get a lot of a lot of us to have we ever bought and go back things out the Internet. out.
Now that's what have to worry about.
So what I've got here is a virtual <unk> <unk>
This is a vision that you get from a device <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the system is understanding is understanding the geometry of your body.
So if we took this idea more far, I thought, instead of just see that pixels in space, how we can make them be physical physics so that we could <unk> <unk>
How would it be a future like this?
At the MIT lab at MIT MIT MIT and my collaborator <unk> <unk> Post, we created this one one one one one one is physical sample.
This is both the computer as users can can move the object anywhere inside of this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was to <unk> -- gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And we would programming the object, the object is, we released from the time time and space, what means that human movements can <unk> <unk> <unk> and go back into the physical world.
You can be able to be physically physically <unk> and physically and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and distance and
Students can use it as well as a tool to understand how to figure complicated as the form of complicated concepts to understand complicated complicated concepts like the planets, the planets of planets, the planets, the physics -- -- the physics -- -- and contrast is a real experience and sense that you can play and feel.
But what's most fascinating that we will change the whole physics physics physics physics is to figure out how to program the world is going to change the world is going to change our world everyday activities.
As you see, digital information is not only show us something something about us as part of the physical world world around us as much as we have to have it <unk> in our world.
We began to talk about today about today about a point of a <unk> but but if we suppressed that barrier, the only limit is left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was going to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> <unk> China was <unk> <unk>
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to <unk> a school for athletes athletes to all get paid.
But but my tiger tiger said, "No." "No."
My parents wanted to become engineering engineering, like them.
After the work of the <unk> Islamic Revolution, they believed really strongly that there was only one <unk> way to <unk> a safe good <unk>
No matter if the job I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be an old dream to be an Chinese opera <unk>
This was me, on my imaginary <unk> my imaginary <unk>
An opera opera should start <unk> <unk> very long enough to learn the <unk> so I tried everything to go to go back to the opera school.
I even wrote the director of the school director of the school in school school, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But to any adult you have to give you the idea.
No adult I am seriously.
Only my friends were excited about, but was a child, no <unk> <unk> me.
So that's what it was just too much bigger to train.
My dream is never <unk> <unk>
I mean, for all the rest of all the rest of my life <unk> a second class was only just going to aspire for.
And this was a bit unfair.
So I learned to look for another <unk>
No one really wanted me to want to do this is <unk>
We went to go back to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The ones that were <unk> in China, in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> <unk> is about Chinese <unk> life.
And it's not a big <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, interesting, interesting. <unk>
That's one one thing for another day.
But the fifth fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> I said, "It's so much different and much better thing to <unk> me.
So it became my tool for me out of this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> relationship with my relationship to <unk>
And I got a meeting with a new culture a new culture also led in place to my <unk> reading <unk>
There are many many different perspectives.
For example, that really seemed to me be a place outside of place because this is what the students in China in China in in China going to do.
I had ever occurred, that China was not focused in, that China didn't have to be in the middle of the world.
A map means the perspective of people people.
<unk> is not a new thing.
It's a common practice in common practice in the academic <unk> world.
There is there it to research camps like comparative religion as comparative religion <unk> <unk> and comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> he offers a deeper understanding of a deeper understanding of more profound understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading comparative read is work for comparative research, and research, research, research, why don't you not do it as well as it as in the life <unk>
So I started to read about books from two to two.
You can can be the people <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that they were involved in a same <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> friends with <unk> experiences.
To the <unk> <unk> are <unk> and politics and spiritual.
By the Buddha, they're all <unk> <unk> <unk> fear and fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read the favorite books in two languages.
<unk> road <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For example, it's all through the translation that I realized is Chinese <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books were opened up with a magic door to connect with people of the past and the present.
I know not to go back to feel that one or <unk> <unk>
Having a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> compared to what many other people have to do.
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream. dream.
Their most important thing is to connect with connect with you with the place that the dreams comes from, where the passion comes from, come from, where the passion, is where happiness.
Even a <unk> dream <unk> can do that for you for you.
And it's thanks to the books, happy today are living here, happy -- living again with purpose and purpose and purpose and purpose and purpose and purpose and purpose and purpose and purpose with purpose and purpose and purpose and purpose purpose and purpose very much very much very much much of time.
So the whole time is always <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> <unk> I saw my first client <unk> first client <unk> first <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical clinical clinic at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Alex was a <unk> first session on jeans and wearing jeans and a <unk> <unk> went on on the couch my office my office was taken off and taken off the shoes on with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class <unk> had a <unk> like <unk>
And I got a <unk> <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could manage it.
But I did not do that.
With the stories <unk> that Alex brought up to the sessions, it was easy to just move the head while moving out to move in.
<unk> is the <unk> new <unk> say, Alex, and for what I looked at -- -- see, she looks at -- -- -- just check -- -- was right.
You start to work to work on, the house later on, have children children later, to death death.
For the <unk> like Alex <unk> I had a <unk> <unk>
But soon I was just going to push to press the press to Alex that talk about her <unk> life.
I got to <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's going to go out with guys with guys under the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> if you were to go on with him."
And then my <unk> <unk> said, "No, it's not not going to go ahead with the next one.
In addition, the best time to work in work in love in Alex is work in love to work in the marriage marriage is work in to work in love to work in the marriage marriage is working in Alex <unk> <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized the <unk> are not <unk> <unk> not new <unk>
Yes, people have to feel a head after what was <unk> -- but but this was not made the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this is like <unk> <unk> were a perfect time and was <unk> <unk>
So I then realized that this is <unk> kind of was that kind of the benign <unk> really had real implications for Alex and his loving life, loving <unk> but for race careers and the future careers, <unk>
There are 50 million people in the United States, today.
This is what 15 means about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent 100 percent that you ever come up to age <unk> <unk> <unk>
Raise your hand you if you're in the <unk>
I want to see the <unk> in here.
Oh Yes! Yeah. It's amazing.
If you're working with <unk> they love a <unk> sleep a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the particles really matter.
This is not just just be just just just about just my view, -- these are the facts.
We know about what 80 percent of the key moments in life is going to go at 35 years.
That means that eight of us mean that eight of us mean that eight of us mean that eight of us mean that eight of us mean that eight of us that eight of us have eight of every 10 10 different decisions and experiences in the way that they can shape their life that life is going to have happened for me when they have 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This audience is going to be right, I believe.
We know that the first 10 years 10 years of a race is going to have a <unk> exponential impact on the amount of money you <unk> out.
We know more than half of the Americans are married, are living in or are going out with their future partner for 30 years.
We know the brain that is the brain is going to come up now is the second and last stage of growth in its <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- which means that if there is that that you want to do is that if there is something that if there is something that if there is something that if you have something to want to do
We know the personality that the personality is going to know the personality changes more sometimes during their <unk> time of life life -- and life life, and we know that the female fertility comes up to come up to the top of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> are the time to <unk> over your body and get on over your body and forth.
When we think about the development of the child, all we all know that the first five years are critical for language and language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment that his daily life is everyday life -- and common has an <unk> <unk> impact on <unk> impact on <unk>
But what we did not just listen to is that that is actually be very often often we heard about is that there is a little bit called an adult called the adult called the adult so-called adult <unk> and our <unk> are <unk> a critical moment in the adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are hearing. are hearing.
The newspapers talk about changes in the changes in the time of the adulthood.
Researchers call <unk> an <unk> adolescence <unk> <unk> <unk>
The journalists had to give them name names of names about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered to be a <unk> <unk> thing that actually is actually the decade of adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you hit an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you have another 10 years of years to start <unk>
Nothing is happening.
They stole that person the sense of urgency agreement and cared for, and ambition and ambition -- absolutely nothing.
And then every day every day, <unk> <unk> <unk> interesting like you or your kids and kids get to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is like is to -- -- -- I know my job is like to do -- -- my boyfriend is like to -- -- -- I know that my boyfriend is like to do -- -- my boyfriend is
Or they say, "Everybody is say that as I started to start a career before the age of the 30, all the 30, all be right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> <unk> and still have nothing to show you.
I had to have a day I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> they were like a game game.
They were all going to run away and get away in, at some time about the 30, they were all going to sit still. out.
I didn't want to be the only one I was going to be the only thing I was going to be the only thing I was going to be the only thing I was going to be the only thing I was going to be the only thing I was going to be the only thing I was going to be the only thing I was going to be the
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds like a little bit high, but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you first leave a lot many lot of things for <unk> <unk> there's a huge pressure at <unk> and so many of us to start a career, to choose a city -- to choose a city to choose a city, choosing a city to choose a city, to choose a city to choose a city, choosing a city to choose a city, to choose a city to pick a
Many of these things are not <unk> <unk> and there's some research that you start to show -- that is much more difficult and stressful and and stressful <unk> <unk>
The <unk> level of <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> is not about to buy red <unk> cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have to have the race that you want right now.
You can see, you can't have to have have the son that you want right now, or can't give a brother for your son.
Many of them <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and are sitting in the room, and talk about their <unk> <unk> "What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are commonly doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk> <unk>
At the 25, Emma came to my office because it was it in his own words, they own own words a words, by having an identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or art or entertainment, but you still couldn't be able to be able to be able to be <unk> at it.
As it was cheaper as it was cheaper, much as it was cheaper as it was cheaper as it was cheaper, it was living with a boyfriend, living with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> that most <unk> showed most ambition.
And even though we were to live on very hard -- very hard -- very hard -- very hard to -- was even more difficult.
They are often going in in our sessions, these sessions, sessions, sessions, <unk> <unk> I would say, "One doesn't you choose your family family, but to choose your friends."
Well, one day later, came his head on his head over his legs and cried for almost the entire time.
I had just buy a new book to <unk> <unk> and had the whole <unk> morning <unk> <unk> with many <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
He was a <unk> point of the <unk> when he saw and said, "Who is going to be for me if I got a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care to take care for me <unk>
At that point, I had a lot very hard job to resist and say, <unk>
What I needed this Emma needed was not mean is a <unk> that really do be <unk> for.
Emma needed a better life better, and I know this this was his opportunity.
I had to have learned a lot about a lot long since I worked with Alex just like to do with Alex just like to just sit at as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So for the next next few weeks and weeks, months, I read about Emma three things that all of us <unk> -- man -- man -- -- a man -- to know.
First of all, I first told him to Emma me that are <unk> on that design crisis of identity and identity crisis -- and <unk> <unk> <unk>
For venture capital, I mean to do something that is to do something that is to do something something to do something something about to do something something about to do something something about to do something something about to do something something about to do something something about to do something something about to do something something about to do something something about to do something something about to
Doing something is something that is an investment in the investment that you want to be next.
I did not know the future of the <unk> career career, <unk> and no one know the future the work, the future of work, work, the job of work, work, the job of work, work, the work, but do this: this: this: it: capital capital is it generating identity <unk>
So now it's the time for that work of other side side of the country, the country, the country -- of that company <unk> you want to try it it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm looking at exploration -- exploration that I should not count, count, -- by the way, it's not <unk>
It's <unk>
I was like, <unk> <unk> jobs and work that out.
Secondly, I was told by Emma the city city tribes are <unk> <unk>
The best friends are excited about to take you at you at the airport, but the <unk> <unk> people come together with friends with friends with similar minds just the people you know, how to talk, and where do they talk about how to talk, and where do they talk about how to talk, and where do they talk about how to talk, and where do they talk about, and
That new piece of of this is that new capital capital, that new capital, that new person is going to come up near almost always come out of their way near their closest circle.
The new things come to come from what they are call ties together as weak ties friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the people have a bad job or don't <unk>
But the other half of other people don't, and the weak links are <unk> <unk> <unk>
Half of the other jobs created ever <unk> be <unk> then -- know the head of your neighbor is getting a little <unk> <unk>
It is not cheating. It's the science of how the information is going to do.
By the last but less important, Emma believed that you do that you don't choose his family family, but but know their family up.
This was really true when I was growing up, but but grew up, she <unk> for his family. when you got a couple and run your own family. family.
I read about Emma the time that time to choose his family had arrived.
Maybe you think that the 30 is you think that the 30 is that the 30 is that the 30 is that the 30 is that the 30 is that the 30 is that the 30 is the age 30 is better age to sit on head in mind than the age of 20 or even 25 right 25 to you.
But to choose the person you guys live now, or get away with me now, when all anyone on Facebook start walking down on Facebook <unk> <unk> isn't progress.
The best time to work is work in to work in your marriage is before you have it, you do -- -- -- and that mean is to be so focused on love is you at the work.
<unk> your family should be a conscious choice of who and what do you want to instead of just work it work to work or will work it to work it work or to work it to work it or kill you to you.
So what happened to happen with <unk>
Well, we went back up to the <unk> and she found the <unk> roommate in a room room a number one <unk> <unk> I was working on a art art in another other state.
This is a weak bond with weak link the way a job in there.
That offer of work was going to give a reason for me to leave the boyfriend, alive.
Now, five years of five years later, it's <unk> <unk> special <unk> special about events in museums.
This married one man who chose <unk> <unk>
He <unk> his new career, she loves her new family, and send me a letter to say, "Now -- "Now the spaces of contacts up the emergency contacts room space room spaces in the emergency room are <unk>
The story of Emma may may sound easy, easy to be easy, -- but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are like airplanes that of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Just before the <unk> <unk> <unk> fit in its trajectory trajectory -- make a difference between land land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, to the age of the 21 or 25 is a good conversation, a good conversation, a good conversation, a good conversation, a good conversation, good -- a good conversation, a good conversation, a good TED Talk good -- can have huge effect over the years or even even have have enormous effect on in the next few previous generation.
This is my sense that my idea that is worthy about spread to spread all about the <unk> <unk>
It's as simple as the what I learned to tell Alex.
And that's what now I have the privilege now have I have privilege to tell <unk> as Emma every day: day: <unk> <unk> are not new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> get a identity <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> your family.
Don't they define define what are they important to define define what do they do or know what did they did.
They're doing their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job working on a management work management job management <unk> a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics at the <unk> <unk> <unk> schools in New York.
And as any other teacher, set up test and test tests.
I gave it tasks.
When I go back up, go back up to get grades.
What I was called up with attention me is that the <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those people who had a better performance have a better performance <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were smarter at, not about going to be so well.
And that's what got me to think about.
The kind of things that you need to learn in math in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But these are these concepts are not impossible and and be convinced that every one of my students could can learn to know if they worked hard for me and during time enough.
After many other years of <unk> <unk> I got to find the conclusion that what we need in education is education -- is a better understanding of students about students and learning from a <unk> perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure it very much better ways to measure it.
Is that the <unk> but what happens if to be successful in school and life, in life it really much more than the ability to to learn in very fast way fast and quickly.
So I left the classroom and went to the classroom and go to college to become a <unk>
I started by looking at children and children in all kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and every study my question was, who is going to be successful and why?
My research team of research, and I went to the <unk> West <unk> West <unk>
We are trying to try to predict what <unk> were going to do it -- in the military training <unk> <unk> <unk> military training.
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> trying to predict what kids would we going to get away the way far possible in competition.
We studied <unk> working in slums really difficult -- <unk> what teachers are still going to still be teaching for the end of the <unk> school <unk> and <unk> who will be most effective in improving the results of their <unk> <unk>
We are partnered with private businesses, companies, ask yourself, what are we going to hold their job on work.
And who is going to going to make most money?
In all of these very different contexts -- emerged one as a important <unk> <unk>
And it was not social <unk>
It was not the good look, physical health, physical health and not <unk> <unk>
It was the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is passion and resilience to getting very long in the long long term.
<unk> is to have a <unk>
<unk> is clinging to their future, day after day, day after day, day, it's only a week, not only for a week, it's not only for the month, it was a month, and work really hard to make that future one future future.
<unk> is living in living life as though is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
A few years ago ago, I started studying the determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of a thousand high school students in high high school students about determination of determination and then wait about more than one year to see that they were <unk> for.
It turns out that children are more able to have much more much greater likely chance of it <unk> them in every question that I could measure, measure, measure, as much as much sure they felt about when they were in school.
So that's not only only be only in West West Point, or the National <unk> National <unk> <unk>
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is determination about what science is about to have science about.
Every day, I parents and teachers ask me, "How to how do we understand how our determination in children?
What do I do to do to do to teach the kids a strong <unk> <unk>
How do we keep keep them for very much for the <unk> <unk>
The most honest answer is, is, I don't know.  --  -- what do we know is that the talent is to do is what is an <unk>
Our data is very clearly that there are many many many talented individuals they just don't go ahead ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data data, the commonly is commonly related or embrace inversely inversely inversely because to the talented <unk>
Up until now, the best idea I've heard about developing life determination in children is called <unk> <unk> <unk>
So this is an idea that was developed at stage at Stanford University of Stanford <unk> <unk> and is the belief that the ability to learn to learn is this is it that we can change it with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow into the response to the challenge, challenge, the challenge, they <unk> because they don't think that that is failure that failure is going to be a missing condition.
So the growth of growth is growth in growth is a great idea to develop <unk> <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I'm going to finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we got to do.
We need to take our best ideas, ideas, our stronger intuitions <unk> <unk> <unk>
We need to measure whether that have have been successful is to measure whether they have have been successful and measure if have have been successful and have to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be able to be able to try it to us how are we going to try and start all again
In other words, we need to need to make our children be more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> <unk> one of my most <unk> memories <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Since that time, I was just going to get off by this incredible language.
But for a foreign sense, it seems to be as much like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like like the Great Wall <unk>
In the last few years, I've been asking myself if I can put down break down into this <unk> so that is anyone that you want to understand and understand and appreciate the beauty in this sophisticated language can we do that.
I started thinking about how a new way a new method we can learning about Chinese could be useful.
Since I was like since I started to learn how to draw each every one of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned about new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have only have only have only have we have only have only have we only have only have only have we only have only have only have we only have only have only have we only have only have only have we only have only have only have we only have only have only have we only have only have only have only have we only have
A <unk> Chinese academic <unk> <unk> <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand thousand <unk> to understand basic literacy <unk>
The first 200 will you have to understand about the basic idea of the web pages of web pages.
So I'm starting to start with eight to show what the the method works.
Are you ready? ready?
You open your mouth as much as much as much as possible as you even be <unk> as much.
You get a mouth. out.
This is a person who is going to go for a walk.
<unk>
If the way of fire is fire is you is this is it be <unk> the form of the form of the called, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a tree.
tree tree. tree.
This is a mountain. <unk>
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door, you like door door door door door door door door door, the door door door door door door door door door door door, the door door door door, the door door door door door door door door, the door door door door, the door door door door door, the door door, the door door door door, the door door, the door door, the door door
I called the radical <unk> <unk>
They are building blocks building blocks together so much more characters.
A person.
If anybody walk back, back, this is <unk>
As the old one, two are <unk> <unk> -- three are <unk> <unk>
If one person stretch your arms, this person is saying about <unk> it big.
The person inside the mouth, mouth, the person is <unk> out.
It is a toilet a kind of like <unk> <unk> <unk>
A tree is a <unk> two trees together, together, we got a forest.
Three trees together, we also got the forest.
Put a table underneath the tree, we have the foundations out.
Put a mouth on the tree, this is a <unk> -- --  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- to remember, one -- one one a tree is a very idiot.
Do you remember <unk>
Two of them together, it's very hot.
Three of you together, that is a lot of a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two two trees, that's <unk> <unk>
For us, the sun is the sun the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk> <unk>
Put the sun and the light shining together, -- this is the <unk>
It also means morning, tomorrow, after one day and a day one day.
The sun comes out over the <unk> horizon.
A door -- put a chart inside the door, is the <unk> <unk>
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> <unk> is someone at home?
This person is coming out hidden out from one door, you <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk> off.
Three women, <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we've already spent nearly 30 characters.
When we use to use this method method, approach, the first eight <unk> will you will allow them to build them to build 32. out.
The next group of eight characters were to build a other number of 32.
So with every small effort, you can learn to learn a couple of hundreds of characters -- -- that is the same thing that one was for an eight Chinese about.
So after I met the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain fire. It's a <unk>
We know all that Japan is the <unk> <unk>
This is a sun put on with the beginning, because Japan is to this of China.
So one sun is just like a sun in the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese <unk>
The character on the left is the one two mountains stacked up one over the other.
In the old China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political <unk> <unk> political <unk>
Today, the age today -- today is today, the age today is -- now -- today -- today, the age today is the age of the day.
A mouth is a mouth one going to say it where is going to go out is going to come next. out.
This is a slide to remind me that I stop talking and talk and talk and talk and talk to the stage.
What I would like to be my dad <unk> are the movies that I came to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my favorite films with my <unk> <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the <unk> <unk>
The movie <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite favorite piece was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
He gave a good little <unk> <unk> using a brilliant dress while wearing a bright dress and bring a magic partner.
But when you look at that film so many of the time -- many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable as an remarkable one.
Now we now live now live in and raised our children in a kind of complex industrial complex industrial complex evolutionary process of complex industrial complex industrial complex event of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
However, the magician of Oz was in -- was a event an event event was event.
It didn't have that trend.
The trend is really actually took rise by the rise up the rise past 40 years later on, with, interestingly, another film movie -- whose way <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> girl as a guard <unk>
You know what I'm talking talking about?
There's a great difference between these two two films, -- there is a big couple of big differences in the big big differences between the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all see today.
One is that there is very little violence in the <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are monkeys very aggressive, are <unk> too.
But I think if the magician is that if the magician is in the case that if the magician is <unk> do today, the magician today, the magician today, the magician today, the magician is <unk> -- <unk> you are the salvation salvation <unk> <unk> <unk>
You do have magical magic shoes to defeat <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another one one thing one thing one thing about the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the
I started to know this when I did was to see "Star Star Trek. My daughter, <unk> years later on, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I had also also have a kid too.
It's only three years.
He wasn't invited to the projection because was still very small for that.
But it was the second second son, and the <unk> level of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  -- --  --  -- so in the room room, and I was able to just like a mom in a mom left with his <unk> back, behind,
I wonder what <unk> <unk>
Would you be kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I should a sense sense that Luke sense is one <unk> army to <unk>
I was going to get this up with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
How does do you make a Dorothy <unk> Dorothy your movie?
And I was doing good for us with good <unk> <unk>
It's the kind of the world that I want my kids to to grow up to be <unk> -- and not a world of men that <unk> that is where we are.
Why is there to be so much force in capital capital capital out of force capital out the movies for our kids, and just so much about path of <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of a lot lot of literature about the impact of movies of the male male movies of male violence in male violence in the girls, and should <unk> <unk>
I've not read so much about how kids react to this <unk>
I know by the first <unk> <unk> <unk> doesn't really give you to give it the right framework right to me navigate for the world of the adults that is <unk>  --  -- I think at the first time of first of the first <unk> really really do is -- at the point of the first <unk> really really do is -- at the point of the first
My quest is finished, I finished, I got a <unk>
Why do you stop standing there? there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat by <unk> <unk> and get their reward, for other relationships or other <unk>
It's kind of as if you for being a kid, you have to be a kid, you have to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you have to use a <unk> <unk>
There are many many different exceptions, and defend the <unk> <unk>
But they send a message to the kids, they kids, they guys are guys not really about your target audience.
They make a great work work when we defend against the <unk> but don't necessarily show the kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no no model for them.
We also have got a few great women who writing new stories for our kids, as real and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Of course, the most successful issue of all time is in all times is going on, is going on in the time is going to come up in the time is going to come up in the times of times of times time is going to come up in the time is going to come up in the time is going to come up in the time is going to
Until many of you are thinking about this -- this year, actually <unk> <unk>
I recommend course all all of you all all you all all of you. you all all do.
Do you remember what the critical criticism said when went <unk> out.
I can't not believe that Pixar is Pixar is exactly believe that Pixar is that Pixar is a movie <unk> movie film.
It's very good for you not to stop them.
Well, almost none of these films is about the <unk> <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It is not going not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to get around, but maybe we're going to get a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book <unk> comics, and in the 1980s, years, I recorded a conversation that I had to have with a friend friend about the movies that you saw.
And it's a very simple thing. There are only three questions that you must <unk> -- -- -- -- in the film, film, film, there's more than a female character that is going to have lines?
So you have to have the <unk> <unk>
These women are talking to each other at some moment in the film?
Their conversations are more apart from the kind of you like like like?  Thank you.
Two women who exists and talk about things to each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and hardly see it in the cinema cinema we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality <unk> <unk> <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a idea of a consensus design idea of what is a Hollywood <unk> movie <unk>
<unk> doesn't about the <unk> test.
And I don't not think that we are going to get it because a lot about the movie, much of the movie movie, don't you have seen -- a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of
We have many many scenes of men that have profound conversations and painful and painful and painful and painful and painful and painful time for one of the <unk> <unk> would have to take a look at the door door, and say, <unk> to the bed <unk>
This is Hollywood Hollywood.
So let's go back in in the numbers.
In 2011, you of the 100 popular movies <unk> how many of them think they have International <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women have been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen recently been chosen
But there's a larger number than this is going to go through with this room.
Last year, The New York Times was published published a study that the government had done.
This is what he was saying.
In the United States, one of every five of five of five other five women said it has been sexually <unk> sexually <unk> <unk>
I don't think it's the fault of the fault <unk> <unk>
I don't know, movies for kids to have something to do with with that. with with that. with that. with that.
I also think about music music or music music or pornography are now going wrong wrong, and when I listen to that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a great amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> <unk> What are you <unk> for?
What are they not going to do with it?
They're <unk> the story that the role is a a male hero of a male hero of a male hero of a male hero of a male hero of a male hero of a male hero of a male hero of a male hero of a male hero of a male hero of a male hero of a male hero of a male hero of a male hero of a
We're all going to do is that that story story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like to raise a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world -- and this world and is that we want to do with it <unk>
We have to have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you want to be <unk> -- are going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you know, at the same time, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list list is a way to do something something really important, and here I mean mainly about the parents.
I think we have to have to show our children male children a new definition of <unk> <unk>
The definition of man man described is completely changing.
You've read about how new economy is going to read about how new economy is going to read about how new economy is looking out of home and <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter -- what was his <unk> favorite <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
What do you have to do with all have these <unk> do have in common?
Maybe it's not only only be only only be only only be only only be only only be only only be only only be only only be only only be only only be only just be just the only touch alone.
I think they are actually experts.
And I think these are the two people in those movies in those movies that they know -- and love to share their knowledge with other people's knowledge <unk>
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories of stories for my daughter, <unk> and like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories where I'm going to tell my <unk> <unk> <unk> and struggle just and more stories of stories where their work is to see their work work is join a team -- is to help other people improve their way better.
Thank you.
As I was a little boy living in Maine in Maine and one of the things that I thought about was to look for the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of sea
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They are covered from sand around, and it's hard to look at them.
However, I had the time with time, I was going to get myself at <unk>
I started to see ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This was a passion for finding things, on a love past and <unk>
And finally, when I finally started to look at <unk> <unk> <unk> I realize that I saw with my own eye eyes it enough.
Because suddenly, suddenly, in Egypt, my little little little in nearly 1.3 miles of length along with the <unk>
And my sea <unk> <unk> had grown up the size size.
This is really really bring me using satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew what had to do it differently.
I want to show an an example one example of how different different you can see when we use <unk> <unk>
This is a place in located located that one place located located located in place located in place located in place located in the eastern six Side of Egypt called <unk>
And then the whole simple view, seems to be a brown, <unk> but when we use this infrared that infrared is infrared and process this infrared it using false <unk> suddenly the place looks like bright as bright.
What are you looking at is the real chemical changes of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape
And I want to share with you how we use data the satellite data used to find a <unk> city, <unk> <unk> <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital capital of the ancient Egypt Egypt for more than 400 years of time called the <unk> <unk> about 4,000 years ago.
The place is place in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East the Middle East, the Middle East, of the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> have always known that we have was <unk> -- was there in one place near the <unk> of the two kings that <unk> <unk> <unk> inside the red circles <unk> right here, but somewhere inside this enormous amount of <unk> <unk>
This area is enormous about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to the side of <unk> <unk> and as it changed over time, it was changed over time, moved it moved by to this room and covered all the entire city.
So how do you find a city city is going to find a look at a city <unk> in a <unk> <unk> landscape.
And I'll try and find out of the point that the equivalent of look for a look for a <unk> needle in a <unk> with the eye <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we had to use this NASA data <unk> NASA is going to make a map of the place, very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where do we have this <unk> <unk>
But you can see is more <unk> and is even more interesting -- this is slightly small area of little little bit tiny bit nice, circle that you can see inside the circle here, we thought might be the <unk> location.
So we collaborated with scientists with the African scientists doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
When I say, <unk> it's like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but instead of climate change of climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change, climate change,
Five of a thick <unk> thick <unk> <unk> <unk> we found is a dense layer of <unk> <unk>
This means is that that is a possible <unk> location of <unk> five <unk> <unk> <unk> -- several several hundred years of years of the several hundred years of years, that of many hundreds of years of the several hundred years of years of the many hundreds of years that date of the many hundreds of years that date of the many hundreds of years that comes out of the
We also found this is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the most common stones used in the most common stones used in the <unk> most common stones used in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> these are the stones <unk>
So we have a dense layer of dense <unk> of the occupation of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We also have a evidence of a evidence of a evidence of an elite evidence that is evidence of an elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite
We were still not <unk> over here, but go back into the place in a near future <unk>
And even more important, we have resources to train young young young young young women Egyptians in the use of the satellite technology use computer technology use technology -- can they also do with great big discoveries.
I want to end up with my favorite quote from the Middle East, of it was probably written in <unk> <unk> four years ago.
Now share knowledge is the most majority of us <unk>
There's nothing like on the ground.
So according to me, TED was not about founded was founded that that it was founded was founded that that it was founded that it was founded that it was founded that it was founded that it was founded that it was founded that it was founded that it was founded that it was founded that it was founded that it was founded that it was founded that it was
Do the ideas really have actually started in in 1984 degraded B.C. manufactured in a lost city not for a long time and found it very much.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> into <unk> perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I just want to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to
Imagine standing outside, in front of the front door of the <unk>
I want you to get you to pay attention to the color from the door, the material that is made.
Now I have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Are you competing at a <unk> <unk> race <unk> and go in direction at their front door.
I need to look at this <unk> <unk>
They're <unk> strong <unk> they're <unk> -- just go <unk> very much.
They collide behind the front against the door door door door door door door door door door door door door door to the door door.
There are all <unk> flying all around all the parts parts, <unk> parts, wheels of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
When I go to the lobby, the hall the hall the hall the hall, or what happens to the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light light light, <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's that it's <unk> waving with your hand hand with hand.
This is a brown horse six like a brown cobalt horse.
It's a horse a horse <unk>
You can just feel the blue <unk> they're going to make it tickle your nose.
You can just smell the <unk> cookie <unk> cookie cookie cookie cookie <unk> cookie <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> on the side and enter your living room. out.
In the room room, and make the maximum imagination of your imagination, you just imagine Britney <unk> <unk>
He's with little <unk> clothing dancing about his <unk> <unk> singing <unk> <unk> One more <unk>
Now I'm going to go back to the kitchen.
The floor has been coated with a <unk> yellow <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Okay. Okay. Okay.
So I want to tell you about a particular competition that is done in New York. in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago ago as a <unk> <unk> planning, waiting, -- -- I guess, that that was like the end of a <unk> <unk> <unk>
There were there many men and a few few ladies in different ages and different ages and different habits <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers <unk> <unk> <unk> only once.
We were going to look at the names of dozens and strange strangers.
<unk> poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the <unk> the order of a deck of a <unk> <unk>
And I was like, thinking, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena of nature.
And I started to talk with some of some of the competitors. of the competitors.
This is this one, this is a man called Ed Cook <unk> who had come from England and had a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I asked him to <unk> when you realize you were a <unk> <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not not a brilliant person.
I actually have have a matter of the average memory in reality, I have to have a lot of the other average memory.
All the ones who are involved in this competition is being involved in this competition is going to participate in this competition is normal in normal memory.
We said, "We have been trained to do that we have been trained to <unk> use to <unk> <unk> <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> do you know what had I ever hear about this <unk>
And we were standing out out of the way of the way of the competition, and <unk> <unk> a wonderful and bright English and brilliant English and bright English and brilliant English and brilliant English and brilliant English and brilliant English and brilliant English and brilliant English and brilliant English and brilliant English and brilliant English and brilliant English and brilliant English and brilliant English and bright English and bright
Did you meet Britney <unk> <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney to Britney <unk> <unk> how do you like to memorize the order in a deck of a <unk> <unk> live on national television. line.
So that's what you want to the world that anybody can do this."
And I said, "Well, I'm not not Britney <unk> <unk> but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to have to have to have you have to have you have to have you have to have you have to have you have to have you have to have to have you have to have you have to have you have to have you have to have you have to have to have you have to have you have to have you have to have
And that was the very beginning, of a very strange journey was very strange for me.
And I ended up the most much more part of the most last year year, not only training my memory, but try to understand how to understand how it might sometimes work and work and what your potential is like.
I met a lot of really interesting people really interesting.
This is a man called <unk> <unk>
He's a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> probably with the worst memory in the world.
Their memory was so bad that I didn't even remembered that it was a <unk> problem of <unk> <unk>
Somebody was incredibly tragic, but but it was a window going to allow us to see how extent our memory is us that we are.
On the other end of other end of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum, I first met this man.
This is Kim <unk> <unk> <unk> He <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We went through in the public library in the Salt Lake City <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And on the back, you get a whole amount of a whole amount of treaties about writing about writing news written by written by writing it is something more than 2,000 years ago in the <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is about is that there was a time that is that this idea is having to have this idea of having that is that this idea is having to have this idea of having to have this idea of having this idea of have this idea of having this idea of having this idea of having this idea of having this idea
A long long ago, people invest in their memory, when to provide it <unk> their minds.
These techniques have done possible for our modern world, but have we really changed.
We have to have have us have to have the people have to have have have have changed as have any cognitive <unk>
As we already have have to have have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we have to have we need to remember, sometimes we often seem that we've forgotten how to do that.
One of the last places in our planet where is still really passionate about this idea of a a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is such extraordinary competition is <unk>
It's actually not so <unk> -- is there that one is that <unk> <unk> -- is there that is that we have work that <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at University of University of London was invited to invited a group memory memory group in the lab.
They wanted to know -- is to know, -- know -- is to know, -- know, -- will be that it have a kind of brain brains in a way, the structural can sort of a kind of a certain structural way, or <unk> <unk> <unk> different than the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They are smarter than <unk> <unk>
They gave them a <unk> battery of cognitive test -- and the answer was really no. no.
There was a really interesting and significant difference a significant difference significant and significant difference significant and significant difference significant and significant difference significant difference a significant difference meaningful and meaningful difference significant difference significant and significant difference significant difference to a lot about brain brains brains and memory of control control that we have <unk>
When they put them in an MRI MRI <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> brains -- when you -- look at numbers, -- faces and <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> one part of the brain that involves space involves space <unk> and navigation.
Why? You have something to learn about this?
The freestyle tournament of <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> is running like a kind of a new career career that every year comes up with a new way to remember more to remember more things, more quickly, and forth the other day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
On her desk, in front of him, you have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> point of trying to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented was invented before.
He used a very similar technique to memorize the order precise <unk> precise <unk> <unk>
It was in half an hour. Yeah. Yeah.
And while there is a large number of ways that we remember about is to remember things in these <unk> -- absolutely all all the techniques used at the end -- at the end -- at the end -- at the end -- at the end -- at the end -- at the end -- at the end -- at the end -- at the end -- at the end
It illustrates it is a <unk> paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> He says to two people to remember the same word. I remember -- you -- to you, you guys -- that there's a man called <unk>
That's her <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> you have a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I get back back later, later, and I ask to do with you -- that word I told you to a <unk> <unk>
<unk> What do you do?
The person who was told her name is Baker <unk> <unk> you probably remember the same word that the person was going to ever remember that their work is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> ability to <unk> <unk>
What's wrong about here?
Well, the name Baker, really doesn't mean mean for you mean for you for you, for you -- for you. <unk>
With all all the other memories you dance for his head. out.
But the word -- we know <unk> <unk>
They used white <unk> <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> <unk>
They were going to get well when they go back home to work.
You probably would have a <unk> <unk>
And when you <unk> that word for the first time, we first started putting <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
One of the most elaborate techniques <unk> to do this is two two thousand years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> <unk> <unk>
History says like this: There was a poet called <unk> <unk> <unk>
And they had had hired as entertainment, as entertainment, because if you wanted to give a very good party, he didn't get it at a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
He went up up up up up up up up up into his memory, by the memory of memory -- and you <unk> <unk> and as soon it was, is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> all the everyone.
But not only it only only kill us all, all, but shattered the bodies <unk> <unk>
No one could be say who was there one there, nobody could remember where they were sitting in.
So they could not <unk> you know the <unk>
A <unk> <unk>
He was standing out out out, only one was going in in the middle of the rubble, closed up the eyes and realized that with the eyes in his head, eyes in his mind, and mind -- with the eyes in his mind, and head to see where it had been sitting in.
I took the family <unk> <unk> where they were really loved loved ones in between the rubble.
What do you have to pick up at the moment is something that we all know about <unk> <unk> -- and is that no matter if we are not good for you to first to remember names or remembering names of the name or first remember is to remember whether are we good enough to remembering name names of the names or first to remember is to remember whether are
So if you <unk> to me that I have the first 10 10 words of the history that I just told you about <unk> <unk> -- is it that you have very hard to do that.
But I would bet out that if you told you to say who was sitting on the horse on the horse -- on the horse -- on the horse on the horse -- on the horse -- on the horse -- on the horse -- on the horse -- on the horse -- on the horse -- on the horse -- on the horse -- on the horse -- on
The idea of the palace <unk> is to create this building together with the eyes of his mind and <unk> <unk> <unk> images of the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work? work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage for a talk, and you want to do it of the same way it would have made it <unk> if they were going to be able to get it for him for him for him for him for him for him for him for him for him for him for him for him for him for him for him
What could you do is to do is you imagine is that they are on the door back home.
And he came to come up with some kind of an image absolutely ridiculous, <unk> crazy <unk> crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that is that is really mention is that is that is really mention is that is really mention is that is really mention is that is really mention is that is really mention is that is that
And then you can imagine imagine that entering your house, house, and see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that will you remember that you want to introduce his friend Ed Ed Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> <unk> just remind that funny anecdote that they want to count.
And then I go back in in the kitchen, and the room that they would talk about would be a strange journey that they did for a whole year, and have some friends to help them remember that. for.
So this is like the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> word for word word -- is a typical typical thing.
The <unk> <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought of the <unk> and in the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> is first <unk> would be like the first place in its <unk> <unk>
I saw that this was just fascinating about, and I go through full full full about.
I went to some point of these memory that memory -- and write a whole thing about this <unk> thing about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem. <unk>
The problem was a problem was that is a a memory competition is a is a <unk> <unk> event.
Seriously, like to see a look at a whole bunch of people sitting on taking tests.   -- to say, that the most exciting thing is that happens is when you get left behind the front. out.
I'm a journalist and need to be able to write about something.
I know there are some amazing things going happening in the minds of these people people, but -- but don't I have access to.
I realized if I was going to tell this story story, I was trying to try to put in place in place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes to all sit at the New York Times Times, just trying to remember what to remember it to remember it.
Maybe a poem. Or is the names of an old school <unk> <unk> bought a <unk> market market.
And I found that this was funny <unk>
I would never have expected to do it it?
It was a fun, because because it was not just about to train memory.
What is actually about doing is to do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do is do
I was really excited about this.
This is me, using my standard standard training of training <unk>
It's a couple of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with tape just two <unk> <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a <unk> <unk>
I ended up back back back to the same competition that I was covered a year before, I had the idea that you could -- in a kind of a <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be a good job for good <unk> for my whole whole whole whole whole whole thing.
The problem was the problem was that the experiment was a problem was like is the way that the experiment was problem is that the experiment was a problem is that the experiment was a problem was that the experiment was that is that the experiment was a problem was going out of control.
And I got the <unk> something that I had not to happen.
Now, it's a cute thing to be able to memorize things and <unk> and phone phone numbers, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because they are based in pretty much fairly basic principles about how the brain works.
And it's not necessary that you have to have you need to do is that you have to do is that you have to do is that you have to do is that you have to do is that you have to do is that you have to do is that you have to do is that you have to do is that you have to be set up to
We're often talking about people about people with a great memory as if you had a gift donated <unk> but is it not the case.
Big <unk> <unk>
The most basic, <unk> <unk> <unk> when we paid attention.
We were just going to focus on deeply.
The palace of <unk> <unk> these memory techniques, are memory memory skills, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> <unk>
They work because they are going to get it in.
<unk> a sort of deep processing processing processing, is a kind of complete care attention that most most majority is not going to come <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there is no <unk>
That's how much things are doing <unk> <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave with you with with you with with you with leave with you with you with with you with with you with with you with with you with with you with with you with with you with leave with you with leave with you with you with leave with you with you with with you with you with with you with
How much are we willing to do is losing care attention to you lose what is already that is our short <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> not attention to the human being left in front of us, the people who -- who is not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
I learned about first first hand that there are some incredible memory capabilities of incredible memory capabilities of incredible memory capabilities of incredible memory capabilities of incredible memory capabilities of incredible memory capabilities of incredible memory capabilities of incredible memory capabilities of incredible memory capabilities of incredible memory capabilities of incredible memory capabilities of incredible memory capabilities of incredible memory capabilities of incredible memory capabilities of incredible memory capabilities of
But if you want to live a little <unk> <unk> you must have to be the kind of one person who remembers <unk>
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk you about the last 30 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we would just just put it back just a <unk> place, New Jersey.
Because this is 30 30 years ago, I was from a <unk> Jersey, I had six years old, and she was living at home my parents' house home my parents' house home my parents' house home my parents' house house home my parents' house home my parents' house home my parents' house house home my parents' house home my parents' house house my parents in my parents' home home my
In the corner, since my <unk> was <unk> I was shared with my sister.
And between my dorm bedroom and the bathroom, the bathroom, had a balcony that I would a living room. out.
And there are all you all spend the time I was looking at the TV <unk> so every time I went out of my room room, to the bathroom, everyone was going to come in, and get wrapped up in a <unk> <unk> basis.
And I was like this.
It was that <unk> <unk> not and hated it.
We were going to get that journey, journey, I hate that <unk> hated that <unk> hated that <unk> I hated that room and that room.
That's the architecture.
That's it.
Those feelings that I felt, -- is that that is the power of architecture, architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, not <unk> <unk> not about <unk> <unk> not about <unk> <unk> not about <unk> <unk> not about <unk> <unk> not about <unk> <unk> not about <unk> <unk> not about <unk> <unk> not about <unk> <unk> not about <unk> <unk> not about <unk> <unk> not about <unk> <unk> not about
And it's not surprising that we are feeling that we are feeling that we are feeling that we are feeling about that way, because according to the Environmental Protection -- -- -- --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under their time. <unk>
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are all around with architecture.
That's so much.
architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice.
That makes us kind of a little bit naive ago and very predictable.
That means when I show you a building up a building, like this, what are you about thinking about <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know what do you have to do this is that we have to do this is that we have to do this is that we have to do this is that we have to do this is that we have to do this is that we have to do this is that we have to do this is that we have to do this is that it is
This is a <unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> use architects to create an emotional connection that we can build our buildings buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection <unk> <unk> we used this trick for a long long ago, a long long ago.
We used to use it about 200 years ago to build the banks.
We used it in the 19th century 19th century thing about it in the 19th century 19th century <unk> <unk>
And in the United States century in America, we use it for building houses.
See, these are <unk> <unk> stable, <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the elements.
This is very, very useful, a good thing to build stuff is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and is very complicated. very complicated.
The people who will <unk> <unk> <unk> and governments, are always afraid about innovation, and they want to use to use the ways that they know that they're going to be working.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk> <unk>
It is the round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round round
But it's not very much to do with a library today.
That same year year, in 2004, the other side of the country, the country was another <unk> library, another library, another library,
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media use in the age was digital age.
It's a new public equipment in public equipment for the city, a place to come back, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same country, in the same country, two buildings, two buildings, both of them that is not very completely different?
And the answer is is that architecture works in the first <unk> <unk>
On one one side is <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies new <unk> <unk> new solutions for the current life.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> so much as we get away with all us about us.
All of the black people of black, this is us like to do do we feel very well, do we feel very well, do we feel very well, do we feel very well, do we feel very well, do we feel very well, do we feel very well, do we feel very well, do we feel very well, do we feel very well, do we feel very well, do we
We need to go to the other side and go back to connect with those <unk> <unk>
So we all do, and are all all happy, but but but but we we felt like <unk> -- so we started to go back up the back forward, again again again and over and forth and over and over again.
Well, this is about 30 <unk> years ago was <unk> over the <unk>
The architects were busy experimenting with experimenting with experimented with the <unk> <unk>
It has to do with it with concrete.
That is a guess.
<unk> small <unk> <unk> <unk>
Something really hard.
So we get close to the '80s, and we started to incorporate these symbols.
It will just bring the line back back the back back in the other direction.
We took those ways we know about and <unk> them.
<unk> <unk> and add bake bake bake a bake of new new materials.
I love it.
We don't not <unk>
We took another <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The forms are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> became a columns.
<unk> grew up to the size size size size.
<unk>
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spend the time in the <unk> shopping centers, <unk> we moved to the slums, and there, in the suburbs, we could actually create our own erotic <unk>
Those of us are able to be <unk> at <unk> <unk> or <unk>
And maybe maybe we have an infinite <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is what happens with <unk> <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They are easy, easy, they're cheap, because instead of create new spaces, we also integrated on different memories in other places.
I know a very good thing, and all you know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio. Ohio.
Architects are feeling frustrated and start making <unk> <unk> the trajectory back back in the other direction.
In the early '90s, we started to experience with the so-called <unk> <unk>
It will just deal with new <unk> <unk> design techniques, and <unk> design techniques, and all us with new <unk> <unk> people some way against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> <unk> <unk> -- one is absolutely <unk>
Typically, the pendulum <unk> <unk> <unk> new in the opposite direction.
But then, something was a <unk> happened.
In 1997, the <unk> it opened this building.
It's the <unk> <unk> <unk> of Frank <unk> <unk>
This was this building fundamentally changed the way of the relationship to the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those very rare moments when they critical <unk> and public <unk> <unk> and public audience in general, really agree about a building.
The New York morning <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao returns up in a half thousand percent percent of them when the building was building.
So all of a sudden, all the whole world wanted one of those <unk> <unk> Los <unk> Los <unk> Los Angeles Chicago, Chicago, Chicago, Chicago, Chicago, Chicago, Chicago, Chicago, New York, New <unk> New York <unk>
Everyone wanted to, one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star. star.
But how is it possible that that is possible that you can be possible that that these are possible that you can be possible that that is possible that these are possible that these are possible that these are possible that these are possible to be possible as possible that you might is possible that these are possible that these are possible that these are possible that these are possible
And it happened, because the means <unk> <unk> us around them and quickly we learn that those forms of forms and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction emotional reaction with these ways.
The main <unk> <unk>
So they all think that if they had these forms, they had these forms, they had these shapes, and tourism.
This is the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the the beginning of our new <unk> <unk> country with other other <unk> star.
It went up to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these other few elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite elite
Think about how do we use this architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have to have have have to have have walked up to the next people to see a building.
The transportation <unk> <unk> you can take a boat, a ship boat, it <unk> <unk>
The technology <unk> <unk> you can see in the <unk> on TV, and in the end, we're all all about architecture in architecture, and the building is all of the architecture of the architecture architecture -- and the building is all about architecture of architecture architecture, and the building are all about architecture of architecture architecture, and the building is all about architecture of architecture architecture, and the building is
The architecture is all all right now, right now, that means that the speed of communications is communications is finally reached the speed of our architecture.
Because the architecture is moving moving down so quick, fast, fast.
It's not very much much long to think about a building.
It takes a lot time to build a building, three or four years, a time, an an an architect an architect can design -- two, eight, you have to design two, eight, you or to design two, eight, you or to design two, eight, you or to design two, eight, you have to design two, eight, you have to design two, eight, you have to design two, eight, you or
Because there's never been good good feedback in architecture.
So this is how we find ourselves with buildings buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how to the <unk>
That is never going to go back to the <unk> <unk> <unk> because we're at the most largest revolution in the largest revolution in the largest revolution in the largest revolution in the largest revolution in the biggest revolution in the most largest revolution in the largest revolution in the largest revolution in the largest revolution in the largest revolution in the largest revolution in the largest revolution in the
My theory is is that when you apply the line to the media, it starts to get <unk> faster, faster, I got to get them in both extremes almost in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the difference between the innovation you and <unk> to the difference between innovation and and <unk> <unk>
We now can do is to do with most symbols <unk> experience is emotional charge emotional charges of something completely new.
I'm going to show you what the system works in a project that my company ended up.
We were <unk> <unk> to replace this building building <unk> out.
This is a center in a village called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a vacation.
But that was that two years before you were finished to the building, it was already part of the community the community -- and the drawings just looked exactly at the end and end the way, there was there not all surprises.
And the building came to be just a building, it became just a building, it became just an image of a building, it was just a building, it was just a building, and just a building, are images that you did the building.
And as you use it to tell their story to tell your story, the personal narrative personal narrative, and make it <unk> with collective memory, these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we no longer need that the Greeks need that the Greeks needs the Greeks need that the Greeks needs the Greeks need that the Greeks needs the Greeks need that the Greeks needs the Greeks need that the Greeks needs the Greeks need that the Greeks needs the Greeks need that the Greeks needs the Greeks need that the Greeks needs the Greeks need that the Greeks need
We can can tell each other what we thought about architecture, we think about architecture, because digital media not only changed the relationship between us, the way they have changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second second in those <unk> librarians <unk>
If that building started building up today, first <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were running around with examples of <unk> <unk> <unk> of innovation, what can it be a library like.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take to the mayor of the people <unk> -- and tell you that there are no unique response to what a library can be a library now.
Let's be a part part of this.
This is this one abundance of solutions day the freedom of experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer a <unk> kind of mysterious creatures they used <unk> <unk> <unk> and abstract drawings and complicated, complicated, complicated, complicated, complicated, complicated, complicated, complicated, complicated, complicated, complicated, are you're not going to be a <unk> public <unk> that you haven't seen before. before.
The architects can listen to listen, -- and you <unk> <unk>
That means the <unk> <unk> of one style of another style of one another, the way to the other one, the one to one other way to the other one, the other way to the other, of a movement -- to the other, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead with and find right solutions right to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of the architecture, what we mean that the buildings in the morning tomorrow tomorrow you actually have buildings in the morning the morning tomorrow tomorrow you are right today.
This means is that an public space in the ancient city <unk> <unk> can be unique and adapted adapted to the measure of a modern city.
So this means one means that one means that one means that one means is that one means that one means that one means is that one means that one means that one means is that one means that one means that one means is that one means that one means that one means is that one means that one means that one means is that a stadium in Brooklyn
This means some robots can be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that are going to make.
That means that the buildings are buildings going to go to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means is that that is a parking lot parking lot parking lot inside in Miami parking large parking parking lot in Miami parking in Miami Beach, Florida, Florida, Florida, Florida, Florida, Florida, he also also is going to be able to do a sport or do a sport or do a sport -- or do a sport -- or do a sport -- or do a sport -- or
This means is that three architects can dream of a swimming swimming on a swimming on swimming on on the <unk> East New York City, <unk> and raise a half million dollars worth dollars of dollars in the cause, is no customer alone. anymore.
It means that any building is too much too small to innovation, as this little <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the animals that are going to observe.
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a matter whether it's a a cow is an cow or a cow or a cow <unk> builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, we built, we built, what we build.
Architects are already known how to make more more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> more <unk> <unk>
We've been waiting for all that all you guys want to do.
Finally, we are no longer on opposite opposite ground.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, better and better world, because there's a lot at play.
The buildings are buildings not only reflect on our society, they do is, it is way to the other <unk> <unk> the local libraries are we going to go to our children kids, and my bedroom room itself.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk> <unk>
It just just turned a year and started walking. walk.
And it does this is great, typical of the children in a year, <unk> <unk> as if his body was too moving too much fast at his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you more like to do for the point you look like to look at the time.
She really loves her mirror <unk>
<unk> and <unk> these same kisses big <unk> <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all all of their friends do this and my mom really do -- -- -- and think about this?
How is that we suddenly is a sudden we're all about really comfortable with <unk>
Because apparently, we not like it.
Every month, a month -- 10,000 people are looking at the talk, are looking at them: <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> it's about this is <unk> it's about this is <unk> it's about this is <unk> he's got 13 <unk> <unk> and lives in <unk> <unk>
And as a teenager, she only only wants to be dear and fit in.
He's Sunday at the night.
He's preparing for the next week in the next week.
It has a little bit confused fear, a little confused confused confused confused confused by the time his mom tells him all the time that is beautiful, beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
And by what his mom tells you and tell him and what your friends or friends, or classmates to say, you don't know who to believe.
So he's a video to a video from her own, it does it on YouTube, and ask others that please please leave a <unk> <unk> I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, he <unk> has more <unk> <unk> <unk>
Some of those of these are these things that <unk> <unk> you not even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a very normal and normal <unk> <unk> who gets these answers into one one of the most stages of their most vulnerable life stages of their most vulnerable life stages of their most vulnerable life stages of their most vulnerable life stages of their most vulnerable life stages of their most vulnerable life stages of their most vulnerable life stages of its most vulnerable life stages of
Thousands of people are trained by posting videos like this, in their most teenagers teenage girls were teenagers trying to communicate this way.
But what are you going to do this?
Well, the teenagers of you are nearly almost never been alone. today.
They're under the online pressure of the online and available all the time, talking about, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Never before we have been so connected in a continuous way on, how they young guys.
As a mother said, "It's how is there a <unk> party in his room all <unk>
There is just no no privacy.
And the social pressures lie out of your hand with that is <unk>
This is environment, as connected is connected, -- is going to encourage our children <unk> based on the number of things like the way -- have and have the comments that they do.
There is no <unk> divide up in a life life in line and life life.
It's really hard to know about the differences that is real real or what it is.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic authentic -- and that is really be <unk> <unk>
What is the most biggest thing in in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a <unk> <unk>
And where are you looking for <unk> <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> remain <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> now is now routine.
And trends are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For those of you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These trends are are associated with women in the women in popular culture today.
It's not really hard to see what are young people compare to?
But are the guys that are also not immune be immune answer immune is?
Like the <unk> <unk> <unk> superheroes of the sport, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But what is the problem with all of this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy to grow healthy and be <unk>
But in a culture obsessed by the image, the image, we're going to show our kids to spend more time and effort and effort to look it, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, development of their physical abilities physical, -- and other ways they started to suffering.
Six of 10 of 10 girls are not going to not do something something because they think they're really nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
These are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and way to fight society and to the country to the work field of the labor place.
31 <unk> almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> to participate in the classroom of the classroom -- <unk> because they don't want to call your attention for their physical form.
One of every five people are not going attending all for the days when you're not feeling comfortable about it.
And in the rainy time, you don't think that you can see is you look at good enough enough, if you don't think you're fine enough enough to -- -- -- -- a note less to the average one to the average point of the average point of your fellow <unk> people who not care about what they looks.
And this phenomenon has widespread is widespread widespread in Finland, Finland, the U.S.
And they realizes irrespective of what they actually weigh these young guys.
So let me be very clear, of us about how you see -- you see what you're really really.
The low self-worth over your body is <unk> <unk> the <unk> performance.
And it's also <unk> health <unk>
<unk> are going to make less physical activity, physical <unk> they eat less little fruit and vegetables, you in more diet healthy that they can take you to a drug <unk> <unk>
They have low low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> the people around around them and are people in higher risk of depression.
And we thought this is all about this for all of this is why they make more <unk> decisions about <unk> and drug consumption of alcohol and drug <unk> <unk> aesthetic surgery, <unk> sexual <unk> <unk> <unk>
The pursuit of the body of the body body is perfect is pushing to the health health system, our government costs about billions billion dollars every year.
And we're not just going to get it out.
Women Are you think they are going to think they have a little bit overweight again, if you have or have no greater <unk> <unk>
17 percent of women don't present in a work interview work in work in a day that they don't feel safe to the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is that is doing to our economy.
If we could get to overcome this, what is that we <unk>
<unk> this potential is interest in interest for each other.
But how do we do that?
Well, I speaking, it does is not just take you very far.
It's not good enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways <unk> <unk> The first one is that we need to have to instill trust in their own body.
We have to help our teenage them to develop strategies to overcome over the pressure of perfect images and perfect images, <unk> <unk>
The good news is that there are many many many programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most people are not really working.
I was very surprised when I learned that many many many many good <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we must make sure we have to make sure that the program that our children are going to just have only have a good impact -- is that we will only have a good good impact -- but also is also an <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focused in six very key <unk> <unk> <unk> influence of family, friends and relationships.
These are these six ways of a critical start to bring a education education for your body self-esteem to work.
A education is a very fundamental thing, but address this problem requires each other one of us to take the charge on into the issue -- and be a better role model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the current status of the women as women are seen, and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians in our politicians <unk> <unk> or size of their <unk> <unk> or <unk> that the amount of the <unk> or successful athlete is not very great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people for what they are, you can see.
All of us can start by doing is that that is assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and image of images and pictures and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can encourage people based on their effort together and their actions and do appearance.
And let me ask you when is the last time that you would have a <unk> <unk>
In a nutshell, we have to have to have to work together as communities of their individual people, to grow our kids to grow to the whole matter of their individual people, to grow for our children to grow to be valuing the whole person to have our children to grow to be valuing the whole person to have our kids to grow to our children their person to grow
We need to put people that is really marking making the difference in a <unk>
It is to make a difference in the real world, real world, we make them be the ones that coming out on the big screen, because we just to create a different world.
A world one world where our children is in where our kids are free to become better -- where the way they think that you can see that you can see is you see that you see is you see you see that you see is you see that you see is you see that you see is you just be able to be able to be able to be
Think of what this can mean for someone that you mean for somebody that for someone that you mean for someone that for someone mean for someone that for someone mean for someone that for someone mean for someone that for someone that for someone mean for someone that for someone that for someone mean for someone that for someone that for someone mean for someone that for someone that
Who do you have in your mind?
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk> A <unk>
Could you just be just the woman who is two two seats long away. I would like to be able to be able to be if it was to it mean for her if it was to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it for you not have to have have to have have to have have to have have to have have
What would it mean it mean for you for her if we have to do this and would it mean that it mean for it that it mean for it mean for her if that it mean for it mean for her if we were to do -- this and would it mean that it mean for your potential that way?
Right now, the kind of obsession with our culture with is the images are <unk> <unk> us all us.
But let's get a <unk> our children the truth.
They will just imagine the way that you can see is only be just one of your identity, you see is just one of your identity your identity, you know, the truth is that we love them for those who are and so much as they feel.
We will just bring it the way to self-esteem in our <unk> <unk>
Let's change each each other one of us, the way we talked about, and connect with other people.
And they <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, to the small <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a year age of age today is going to become sure of insurance agents themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
The five November Five guy is November of a man called called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I walked at a hotel hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the point they were initially who was innocent yet, but but be a prisoner for other charges you have got to plan plan for, plan to about 12 from New York. <unk> including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Fortunately, those plans were <unk> by an FBI <unk> <unk>
Sadly, the bomb bomb 1993 twice in the World Trade Trade Trade Trade Center couldn't not <unk>
He was later <unk> a <unk> would be convicted for your participation in <unk>
<unk> <unk> It's my father.
I was born in in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, as being an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a loving mother, mother <unk> <unk> for me to give it everything for me for me for me to give a happy childhood.
Only when I was seven with seven years, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, a very few, even most Muslims come to know about.
I was just seen when people take time to <unk> it is not much required to get a lot long to reach the way for the same stuff in life.
However, in all of these all of all of all of all of these all all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all
A few months months before of the arrest he was just felt with me and explained that in the last week, I was week about week of week, this week, he was week, and have last week, he was week, and have last week, I was week of a week, he was week, and a few friends, had to throw up to <unk> <unk>
He told me that I go on with him the next day.
We went to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we had not know -- our group group, group, was group -- was hearing by the FBI.
When I got to my <unk> <unk> my father helped me to hold on on the shoulder and and explained how to point point to point to the point point for the point point to point to point to point to the point point for the point point to point to point to point to the point point for the point point what point to point to the point point
That day, I was the last <unk> <unk> shot shot out to the small orange light on the goal and surprise all all, -- especially the goal up in fire.
My uncle went back up to the other and Arab and Arab <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Of such a parent, such child.
All of them -- a lot of them laughter.  But just a few years later, I understood what was that funny.
Did you see in me, same level of the destruction that my father could <unk> <unk>
Those people were later on, would be convicted about putting a stick with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the north parking parking lot underground parking lot of the northern air parking lot fall parking lot of the six people and hurt by the other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
When I turned 19, I had to have moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot very many many <unk> <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable that close as far comfortable as much feel comfortable with close to me about someone was a time to pack and go to another city.
As long as I was always the face new of the kind of the kind of really often be a <unk> <unk>
<unk> secret <unk> my identity <unk> to help avoid be the white <unk> <unk> new of the class -- silent -- <unk> <unk>
So much most of the time you were going to go on at home reading books, watching TV or play games.
For these reasons not develop social skills skills, social skills, -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> <unk> <unk> judge people -- judge people, based on in terms of them at <unk> indicators <unk> people like their race or love. or religion.
So how could I can open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that we had to get in my way thinking, think about, was for me for the presidential election elections of <unk>
In a <unk> <unk> program I was involved in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> up in the subject of the juvenile violence, juvenile violence, I had had been a <unk> <unk> almost my whole life, life, was something that I felt so much about.
The members of this group came out of different <unk> <unk>
And one day, I was going to the end of the convention, I found out that one of the kids that we had ever made, was Jewish age. up.
I took a lot of days to go out out of the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> <unk>
Never before I have had a Jewish friend friend and got me very proud to have he able to beat the barrier that whole life was <unk> <unk>
Another crucial moment came up when I got a summer summer of summer stage summer and summer -- the summer was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I found myself with people all all sorts of beliefs and beliefs and cultures. -- that experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All the whole life had been taught me that the <unk> was <unk> -- was a sin to do, and by extension, all the gay people were <unk> <unk>
Now, I had a sudden, I had a chance to work to work with gay actors there, in a show, and see that many of them was the most nice ones and less critical <unk> I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> <unk> a child, developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others that other -- but not easy for me to do -- exactly the same way I would wish for.
So that's why I was able to contrast the stereotypes that they were a child as a child, as a child, was a kid, a child to the experience in real life.
I don't know what is that that is about being the homosexual -- but know what is going to be trial for something more than my control. is.
Then he came to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Every single nights, Jon Stewart <unk> me to me be honest with me to see that the race race people people, religion or religion -- is nothing to do with with character.
In many ways he became a <unk> <unk> <unk> right time that I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected unexpected. And a Jewish comedian was a Jewish comedian a better influence in my life than my own own father, <unk> <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with a conversation with a conversation with my way to think about, and think, and she said something to do in my heart for my own forever, while she's alive.
She looked at my eyes tired <unk> tired of someone who has had been enough enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> tired <unk>
At that point I realized how much negative energy we negative needs to keep keeping all of all that <unk>
My real name is not <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was changed when my family decided to break the relationship to my father and start to get a new life.
So why I decided to go out out go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because one because I hope to someone, one day, people to try to take on the violence, you can hear about my story and understand that there is a better way -- that is a better way -- that is a better way -- that is a better way -- that is a better way -- that is a better way -- that is a better way
On the other hand, I decided to use my experience to fight and fight and <unk>
I do is do by the victims of terrorism about terrorism is how to the terrible pain and the loss that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
By the <unk> victims of people talking about, to the way of all that <unk> sense, like rejection to the actions of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put up here as the evidence that violence is not really about or race -- -- that kids don't have to have to follow all follow in.
I'm not not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all all.
At this time, there's a film film that is project in their minds. at the time.
It's an incredible <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's in the 3D <unk> <unk> sound <unk> of what you hear about and see right now -- -- but that's that just the start.
Your <unk> <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your body pain, your pleasure. <unk>
It has emotions, anger and make happiness.
He has memories, as a moments of your childhood <unk> <unk> you project themselves to your eyes.
And he is constantly going to be a voice superimposed on in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the film film is film to you feel everything directly.
This is film that film is your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> subject of the mind of mind and world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths about the existence of human being.
Each of us of us is conscious is conscious.
We all have to have an entire film -- love film, you, you and tea.
There's nothing to <unk> more directly.
At least, I know that I have a good job for your own.
I was not sure that you can be aware of.
<unk> is also the reason for a living.
If we were not aware that we were all aware of all know that, in our life life would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of universe in the universe.
Why are we <unk> <unk>
Why do we have these <unk> <unk>
Why are we not just just about just about not only about only do we only do we only do we have only do we only do we have only do we only do we have only do we only do we have only do we only do we have only do we only do we have only do we only do we have only do we just be just
In this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
We will just imagine that to integrate awareness to science, you need some some radical <unk>
Some people are saying that is impossible to be impossible to have a science of consciousness.
The science, of nature is an objective thought.
<unk> of nature is <unk> <unk>
So there was there that there can be there a matter of a science of consciousness.
Because for almost everything the 20th century, 20th century, <unk> that is vision.
Psychology was studying <unk> <unk> behavior <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Even 30 years ago, when TED was very few very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, all of change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> <unk> -- is this is the time for science <unk> <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a whole amount of the scientific work work science scientist about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. I was so cool.
But it also has really have it is also have it is also have it is also have it has have only have it is also have it is also have it is also have it has have only have it is also have it is also have it is also have it is also have it has have only have it is also have it is also have it
The center of the science of the science of science science in the recent years was the quest for <unk> correlations among some of the areas of the brain in the brain in the brain and brain <unk>
We saw a whole thing about this guy in this fantastic work work that featured on Nancy <unk> <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we can understand a lot now that much better, much better, for example, areas of the brain areas of brain are seeing faces or feel a lot or feel happy.
But this is still be a <unk> science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk> <unk>
We know that these areas of the brain are in the brain are all related to with certain types of conscious experiences are known about, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work work in neuroscience is respond with some questions that we want to explain about consciousness. the questions that certain areas of the brain is going to do.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
There is there that there is no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it's not going the real core mystery of this <unk> why is all physical process in the brain that has physical process in the brain that is the physical process in the brain that has physical process in the brain that is the physical process in the brain that is physical process in the brain have to be accompanied accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a complete <unk> internal <unk>
At this point, we can not understand.
And you can say, give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to turn up in another other emerging phenomenon emerging as <unk> <unk> <unk> like life, and and are going to find an explanation.
The typical <unk> are all of the other cases of emerging behaviors, the emerging <unk> work, how do you how are we going to how are we going to behave and adapt and <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is that that we play <unk> <unk> are all about, how to we play with, how do we play with, how do we play with, how do we play with, how do we play with, how do we play with, how do we play with, how do we play with, how do we play with, how do we play with, how do we play with, how do we play
But when it comes to consciousness about consciousness, the questions about behavior are the easy problems.
But the hard problem, it is the question why is that all of our behavior is accompanied with an experience <unk> experience.
And here is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> the standard paradigm of the neuroscience, really doesn't really still have very much to say.
I'm a <unk> heart <unk> <unk>
I want a <unk> scientific <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I was hitting the head into the wall looking for a search theory of consciousness in pure physical terms of physical terms of physical terms of physical terms of physical terms of physical terms of physical terms of physical terms of physical terms of physical terms of physical terms of physical terms of physical terms of physical terms
But by the end I came back to the conclusion that that was not working about for <unk> reasons.
I think we were going to get ourselves at this point.
We have to have a whole range of wonderful explanations of great explanations <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> We got used to this this; the physics explains chemistry, explains chemistry, biology explain chemistry, biology explain biology biology, -- biology explains biology -- is biology that part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in in this way.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
For other other -- we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific <unk> <unk>
I think that consciousness, is right now, is a kind of one <unk> <unk> something that we need to integrate to integrate our view of the world, but don't not even know what do we know what do we know what do we know what do we know what was what really yet.
With an anomaly you like this, you can need to need radical ideas, radical ideas, <unk> <unk> do you need to do need some ideas that to the first we were able to deal with deal with to deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some chance for these crazy ideas. ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today is this one is one one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such such a really hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the whole idea of the very idea of the physical <unk> movie -- movie -- the whole whole idea of the physical <unk> beautiful movie -- movie -- it includes a sort of illusion or illusion or confusion.
So actually, what are you to do, is to explain is to explain how are we going to explain how are we going to explain the functions in the brain, the brain behaviors -- -- and study it all that we need to <unk>
Well, more more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of consciousness that is purely <unk> <unk>
At the same time -- for many many other others, this vision is pretty close to deny that the idea of consciousness is <unk>
But I'm going in in a different direction.
In the time we left, on, I want to explore with two two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk> for.
The first crazy thing is about is that consciousness is really fundamental.
<unk> sometimes take a few different aspects of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe the universe in the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe the universe in the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe the universe in the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe
<unk> laws of fundamental laws <unk> <unk> or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not going to explain in most much more basic.
Instead, you think of you be as much as fundamental -- and that's that is building the world.
Sometimes, the list is fundamental <unk> <unk>
In the 19th century 19th century 19th century discovered is that you can't just explain electric phenomena in fundamental important <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> space space, -- space space, -- space -- -- time, <unk> laws of the basic laws of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I think that is the situation that we found us with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in in terms of the fundamental ideas of the different <unk> <unk> <unk> space -- space -- space -- space -- -- long, time, mass mass, wait, wait, you know, for logic -- you know, for the <unk> on list.
The most natural thing would you have to do is it be <unk> to the <unk> that is a fundamental thing, a fundamental <unk> <unk>
This is not mean that we suddenly is suddenly be a sudden of the object of science at science.
It opens up the way for the <unk> way for <unk> <unk>
So what we need is to study is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that we do with other <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> space space, the time, the mass physical processes processes.
<unk> sometimes they say that we want to really mean that we mean that we want fundamental laws that we could do it for them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is consciousness is something like this.
We want to find out to find fundamental laws so simple as simple as simple as simple as simple as simple as simple as simple as simple simple we could <unk> them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, are, but what are we all about.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system you can have a degree of consciousness.
This is sometimes a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> not only humans, dogs have humans, dogs -- mice, -- the microbes that Rob <unk> <unk>
Even a <unk> it has some <unk> of consciousness.
The idea is not all that photons are smart or do that be?
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress of distress when you thinking about, "Oh my always travel at the speed of the light.
I can never slow down down and slow down and smell it.
No, no.
But thinking is that maybe photons can photons can have any very important sense of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a little bit crazy <unk> for you.
How would anybody think about something that is <unk> about.
And in part of this this is actually come from the first crazy crazy idea of consciousness crazy crazy that consciousness is really fundamental.
If it's a fundamental one, like space space, the time and mass -- is that that it can also be universal can can it also that it can also be universal can be universal. as well.
It also is also worthwhile to notice that even though the idea is <unk> -- is this is much less for different different different cultures, where the human mind is different cultures, where the human mind looks like is to notice that even though the idea is <unk> <unk> -- is this is much for people of different different cultures, where the human minds seems to be more a continuum
A deeper reason comes to comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple shape is most simple and powerful laws that you can think about with thinking about thinking about with thinking about thinking about with thinking about thinking about with thinking about thinking about with thinking about thinking about with thinking about thinking about with thinking about thinking about with thinking about thinking about with thinking about thinking
So there's the information processing data processing data processing information, information, is there's the information processing data processing about.
<unk> <unk> of complex <unk> complex <unk> complex, like in a human being human being human -- is going to be complex -- complex <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> simple information -- simple -- simple information, simple -- simple consciousness <unk>
Something very exciting is that in recent recent years, recent years <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed a theory and developed it <unk> with scientific methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration terms of information, information, information is called <unk> <unk> which is <unk> that is a degree of the information that is integrated it is integrated into a system that is integrated in place that is integrated is integrated in a system.
And it's not supposed to do is you have to have it have to do with is the point with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there is an incredible degree of information integration information integration data integration is a very high degree of <unk> <unk>
In a mouse there is a kind of the information information integration integration integration, information integration integration, integration integration is integration is integration of information integration of information integration of information information integration is integration of information, information integration is integration of information integration of information information integration is integration of information, information integration is integration of information, information integration, integration integration information integration is integration of information, much significant,
But when you get to the ice worms. <unk> microbes, and particles, the <unk> <unk>
The information integration is information integration is smaller -- but it's not zero either.
In the <unk> theory, there will still be a lot of a different kind of different awareness of a different way to zero.
It was actually about a fundamental law of <unk> <unk> high degree of <unk> <unk> <unk>
In addition, other reason is that that is <unk> <unk> can help us bring awareness to the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers are often observed that the physics is physics is a physics -- is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality is actually using a lot of equations, equations, -- but don't we about the reality about the reality that underlies the bottom are.
As it explains Stephen Hawking, "Where are the <unk> <unk>
From this point, the equations of physics is physics -- you can are, but can you use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe what they describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this is vision, the one that you fire fire in fire in equations.
In that view, consciousness is not find out outside the physical world as a kind of <unk> <unk>
It's right there in the center.
So this is vision, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, our relationship to nature, <unk> <unk> <unk> social and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical
Some of them can be <unk> out.
I used to think that I shouldn't have had to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to
If you're a <unk> you accept that vision will you have very much hungry.
I think about thinking about -- well, this is going to transform our vision, while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much about the fact of consciousness, they do about consciousness, it is that it is really much about the fact of consciousness, they do about consciousness, it is that that is really much about the fact of consciousness -- and moral <unk> is not
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other other systems systems of systems -- systems like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence <unk> <unk> artificial intelligence in the <unk> <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of the information <unk> <unk> <unk> she has a complicated information processing of complicated information processing complicated information processing, that the answer is is, -- know if it's conscious.
If this is right, they do are all all have very serious problems with very serious ethical problems about the very serious ethical problems of the development of development of the smart computers and <unk> <unk>
Finally, you can see, in the end, you can ask for the reason for the collective collective collective <unk> world, the planet.
Canada has Canada have their own own consciousness? behavior.
Or to a more local level, an integrated group, we opened in the audience at a TED TED TED Talk, an entire movie film of TED TED TED, different from the inner movies inside <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, -- question, but -- think at least a question that you should take seriously.
So this is <unk> <unk> <unk> be a radical vision, and I don't know if that's the right one.
I'm actually most confident about the first crazy crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental idea that consciousness is a fundamental idea that consciousness is a fundamental idea that consciousness is a fundamental idea that consciousness is a fundamental idea that consciousness is a fundamental idea that consciousness is a fundamental idea that consciousness is a fundamental idea that consciousness is a fundamental idea that consciousness is a fundamental idea
<unk> raises a lot of questions, questions, like, how are those little bits of thinking about the kind of complex things contribute to the kind of complex the kind of complex that we know and love it.
If we can answer these questions, questions, then I think we're going through the right way into a theory of serious awareness.
If you not, well, this is probably this is the most difficult problem of science and science of science and philosophy.
We can't not wait to solve the night in the morning.
But I think we finally finally going to be able to be able to be able to see what to be able to be able to get it to the end.
Understanding consciousness is the key key, I think, to understand the universe and understand the way on to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need to do is we only use the first crazy <unk> idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile -- had a very <unk> <unk>
I went up to school, my friends -- my friends, <unk> myself with my young sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member member member member member was coming up to my parents, because I wanted to <unk> for a community.
And my parents said, "Okay, that's really really nice -- but that's there a such a wonderful problem.
She doesn't really get a <unk> <unk>  -- and they were right.
I went to school, there was good grades. After school, I had a <unk> under my <unk> <unk> and spent a long time looking at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know what a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did not do anything to do anything to be extraordinary that it was extraordinary be really extraordinary about.
Nothing that can be considered as a a achievement if we took the disability outside the equation.
years later, being in the second part of the teaching us in a <unk> high school of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> just after about 20 minutes in a class 11 <unk> <unk> <unk> a guy raised her hand and said, "Hey, when to give you <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
Well, I had only have been talking about <unk> law law for good good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, you know, know you know, know, you know, know, know you know, know about your <unk>
When people were on to the wheels, they talk about <unk> things that in school?"
"Of the general care of the <unk> <unk>
And it was then that this was a child had experiences with disabled people with disability as girls <unk>
And we are not -- -- and not blame the boy, for many many of us.
For us, people with disability are our teachers or our doctors or <unk>
We're not real people -- are not real people. We just <unk>
And in fact, I'm on here on this <unk> stage <unk> to what I do is doing in this of this <unk> wheels, and you're probably waiting for you to tell you, with you.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you are lied to you in relationship to disability.
Yes, you have have been sold the lie that disability is something about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability give you very remarkable.
It's not something wrong with stuff wrong and do is remarkable.
And in the last years, years, we've been able to spread even more even more even more on through social media.
You can have seen pictures of the images like this: "The only disability in life is a <unk> <unk>
Or is this <unk> "Your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or is this <unk> <unk> Department of <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, examples, but there is a great amount of great amount of them.
You may have seen -- have seen one, of the little girl in drawing a drawing with a drawing held held through a pencil held through the mouth.
You may have seen a kid running with a little little bit fiber <unk> <unk>
And there's a whole lot bunch of these images, that are we called a horrible inspiration.
And I use the term porn porn <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a group of people for the other group of other people.
So in this case, we were going to invite the specialists in the benefit of the disabled benefit people without disability.
The purpose of these images are images -- is <unk> <unk> -- so that we can see them and think, "Well, do you mean for very bad that my life is my life, it might be like. on very much.
I could just be that one person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of the number of times that you have been to think that you think that you think that you think that you think that you think that you think that you think that you think that you think that you think that you think that you think that you think that you think that you think that you think that you think that you think that
It was as if you <unk> me for getting up in the morning and remember my own name --  -- and this is <unk>
These images, those images were attached to people with disabled disability people with people without disability.
They're there so that you can can see you and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life is a life being disabled person being challenged -- is really difficult to do.
So let's get a few few things.
But the things that we are currently today about, are not <unk> are all about things that you can think.
They're not wrong things relative things wrong things relative wrong things wrong wrong with our bodies.
So I use the term <unk> <unk> <unk> deliberately deliberately be deliberately going to the so-called so-called <unk> social model of disability, that we are more likely because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about with him.
It makes things the things that I need to do, to do, and have learned to get the best out of your ability to your ability as you do it, and that's what happens with children of those pictures of those pictures as well.
They're not doing nothing doing anything about common.
They are just just using their bodies by getting the best of their ability.
So it's really just going to <unk> in the way we do, to sharing is those <unk> <unk>
When people are like, "You're a <unk> <unk> <unk> it says as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of us be sold for us this lie that disability is us quite quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do that.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here to <unk> inspiration -- -- and you think, God, -- God, God, are you not just inspired by <unk>
And actually, I know what I am.
<unk> of other people disabled people in all time.
However, I didn't just know that I'm more fortunate that I was most lucky than that.
<unk> which is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to collect the things that you get me over to get me from me -- -- -- -- -- the trick trick of how to you will to charge the cell phone battery up.
Great.
We learn to learn about the force and resilience and others, our bodies and our bodies and our bodies -- but against a world to <unk> and get it in.
I really think that is that that is that that is really much of that is that that is that that is that we have been sold us about disability is the disability about disability is most <unk>
It makes us very hard for us.
And that quote: you, is the only disability in life is is a bad <unk> the reason that that's really is because of true that it's not true -- because of the real due of the social model model is.
A lot of lots of lots of <unk> <unk> first <unk> <unk>
Never.    <unk>  -- <unk> on front of a television screen is television will not going to look the <unk> <unk>
Not a whole lot lot of lots of people in a middle of a <unk> <unk> <unk> it is a positive approach to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to going to happen.
I want to really live in live in a world where disability is not about exception, the disability are disability not exception, it is the norm.
I want to live where a little girl in a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom -- looking at the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> not consider to do anything for you about anything to be <unk> for being a way to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have have to have all have we have to have all have we have to have all have we have to have all have we have to have all have we have to have all have we have to have all have we have to have all have we have to have all have we have to have all have
I want to live in a world where we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value we value
disability is not going to get away with us them, but question what you think about about what it does do it.
Thank you.
So what do you have to do have augmented reality is augmented reality and have the augmented reality, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I just answer one to one one of these questions, questions, so -- please don't <unk>
When people are thinking about <unk> <unk> people think about "Minority <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, in air air, you in the air, in air air, you in air air, you in the air, in air air, you in air air, you in the air, in air air, you in air air, you in the air, in air air, you in the air, in air,
Augmented reality is something that happens to happen in our days and is going to happen because we have the tools to do it, and people need to know -- because reality is changing our life change our lives as much like the Internet and the Internet and own <unk> <unk>
So how do we really get the <unk> <unk>
The first step, is what I'm <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure that many people are familiar with them.
What you might not know is is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that
I'll allow you to experience what is to be a good <unk> <unk>
Right now, the only way is going to be on in the field is that I try to get this to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you can <unk> with your imagination.
We can just use the use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is to run through the field of the game of the game <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can know that that you feel like to feel that a man is feeling about that a guy is about 110 pounds of us, you trying to do it <unk> with everything it <unk>
I've been there and I promise you it's not really nice.
So let's take a few few videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the hull, you can give a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the emerging technology is emerging emerging is that it is an emerging up to the surface, but -- do what we can.
So let's look at a video one.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's a horrible <unk> <unk>
One <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> You can see, you can see, is this is a <unk> of what it's going to be <unk> in the football field of football, of the <unk>
You might have to have to have people -- lack people, all the rest of team.
We have a video <unk> of these them, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue 8 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more bit more like feeling that feeling is going to be in the field, but has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, their favorite players have to me on YouTube and <unk> it is you see from the way from a field <unk> <unk>
or a <unk>
We just want to want to do with experiment with experiment with experiment with experiment with experiment with experiment with experiment with experiment with experiment with experiment with experiment with experiment with experience that.
Once we have that experience with <unk> experience with <unk> <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get ourselves from <unk> <unk> how we took it to the next <unk>
We took him at that level that level is called a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> probably many of you many know that many of many people are already about.
The Great <unk> has been described as the sort of the most realistic virtual reality of reality that virtual reality is virtual reality that virtual reality is probably ever created, and not <unk> <unk>
And I'm going to show you why is why with this video.
Man: Oh, Oh, yeah.
No, no, no, no! no!
Oh, my God. Oh, Ah!
<unk> That is a experience of a man in a man in a kind of a man in a kind of a guy in a kind of a guy in a mountain <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What will be the experience of a one fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of one is a fan of a fan of a fan of the fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of one is a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of you <unk>
When I can get to be a <unk> running off of the <unk> <unk> the ball right up to the network? of the network? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What will be their experience experience with you experience when you get a mountain over a mountain over over 100 miles miles a way 100 miles over the way as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But this is not even <unk>
It's just like virtual reality, virtual <unk>
How do you want to get the reality <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality is early early on, when the <unk> and owners see the information about what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to do this to do this to do this to do this to do this to do this to do this to do this to do this to do this to do this to do this to do this to do this
How do we use it for <unk> <unk>
Because they always use the technology technology to win.
They like to gain. You like to win. them.
So here's a brief scenario on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> <unk> were put in <unk> back into his <unk> <unk> <unk>
They won the Super Super Bowl Bowl century won that year.
Other teams decided to do this.
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> <unk> placed in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They had a more <unk> more entertaining. <unk>
In <unk> imagine imagine that you're a player a player player player is going going to go back up in your side you in front of you in front of you in front of you in front of you in front of you in front of you in front of you in front of you in front of you in front of you in front of you in front of
or by the <unk>
They just go out into the field and <unk> <unk>
And the coaches would want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose <unk> <unk> -- you lose <unk> <unk>
If you lose parties for you <unk> as a coach.
And they don't want to do that.
But but augmented reality is reality is only just be a kind of a manual <unk> <unk>
Augmented reality is also augmented is also a kind of a way to collect information information and use it in real time to be able to improve your way better.
How do you do?
Well, one is a very simple option would you have to have a camera in every street corner corner -- the stadium -- having a view from the top of the people that is down.
You also get the information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> <unk> something that's already working on.
And all the whole information is that information is the way to your <unk>
The good teams will you know to be <unk> for?
The bad guys will have a information <unk> information.
This is good for good questions of bad guys.
So your computer team of computer is going to be as important as your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> data will be just going to be just <unk>
It was also going to be able to be <unk> -- who would you have <unk> it.
So how would it happen in <unk>
Imagine what are the <unk> <unk>
It will just take it the ball and <unk>
I will just get a <unk> on the left side of a sudden, a <unk> <unk> on the left side of your bombsight that is going to get you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was going to go to the area of protection.
Another <unk> <unk> <unk> you have an open <unk>
Do you get the <unk> up, the <unk>
And the ball is lost the trajectory.

I mean, don't I tell you, what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
He didn't not cut your wings out, and that is everything.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
I went to the brain <unk> <unk> my brain 18 years ago, and, since that day, the science of the brain is in the brain is going to become a personal passion for me.
I'm engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently have joined up with you that I've recently put you that I've recently joined me with the <unk> Google <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Google <unk> But this is all the work that I'm going to talk about today about science science -- here about science science -- talk about here about science science -- here about science science
Having said this, there is a kind that there is a kind of kind of is there there is a kind of kind of is there there is a kind of kind of is there there is a kind of kind of is there there is a kind of is there there is a kind of kind of is there there is a sort of is there there is a
You're still just kind of as smart as smart as smart or not?
It's not going to be able to go back to <unk>
After the <unk> it was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live to live with.
It was not very gray matter, matter, it was the dead <unk> <unk> dead of the <unk> hormones and <unk>
Immediately from the operation, I had to have to decide what a much more than a dozen more powerful chemicals make, from more than one of a dozen of powerful chemicals take, more than a dozen more powerful chemicals to make, more than a dozen more powerful chemicals make, from more than one of a dozen of powerful chemicals take, more than a dozen more powerful chemicals take, more than
Every day for the last 18 years, I've have to do about combinations about combinations about combinations about combinations about combinations about combinations about combinations about combinations of the combinations of these <unk> and mix it to <unk> to go with life.
Over one time I've been saved for me.
But luckily, I have a <unk> soul <unk> I decided -- to go to try and get the the <unk> doses <unk> I would say it in <unk>
I started to test out different <unk> and trying to see how little changes in the little little changes in the small changes in the small little changes in the small changes in the small <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my sense sense of my sense of my sense of my sense of my sense of me sense of who I was me, -- my sense sense of who I
A particularly <unk> case <unk> for a few months, I tried to study doses for a man of <unk> <unk> and I was just seeing how do we tell my thoughts.
I was always going to <unk> <unk> I was thinking about all of the time in the sex, and I believed that was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- -- of course, many times in the past I've ever met several and many different <unk> <unk>
It turned out as an extreme end.
But my big surprise was that I was not trying to be <unk> for.
In fact, it was a little bit to <unk> a little bit <unk> going to fix a problem in front of the front, and just not just happen like this.
So I couldn't not just handle it.
It changed my <unk> <unk>
But I think about that experience gave me a whole new appreciation new appreciation about men and what they have to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> better with men.
What was what trying to do to the <unk> those hormones hormones and others, -- this is my intelligence after the disease and <unk> <unk> my creative <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So let's just think about almost an entire images, and that became a key <unk> <unk> point of key <unk> key point of key <unk> reference point of the key reference point of key <unk> point of key <unk> point of key <unk> point of key <unk> point of key <unk> point of key <unk> point of key <unk> point of key <unk> point of key <unk> point of key
This kind of thoughts of thoughts -- is not just new. new.
<unk> and you look at things in similar way.
They thought the images and mental ideas were the same thing.
There is very simple for most majority of us, mental images are very important for <unk> <unk> <unk>
So then, after several years, I can find out to find the point right up, and have lots of lots of great <unk> <unk> <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and good <unk>
Now, I'm now working on how to bring you very quickly go very quickly as fast as fast fast as these mental images from my mind the computer.
Can you imagine what would happen happen if a film was going to happen if a film was going to happen if a film was going to happen to happen if a film was going to happen to happen if a film was going to happen if a film was going to happen to happen if a film was going to happen to happen if a film was going to
Or if a musician could be a musician could or get out to extract the music in your head?
There are some amazing possibility of this, as the way that people creative can come to share the speed of the light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty is going to do is to do this is just increase the resolution of our brain <unk> <unk>
Let me show you why I think that we are pretty close to get this to with two recent experiments that was two recent experiments that by two leading groups in neuroscience.
Both of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The column on the left left is the left left shows the scanning case scan of a person looking at an image.
The average column in the middle is the brain scan of that same individual as you can <unk> it was looking at that same image.
The column on the right one is <unk> <unk> the contents of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> You can see that the difference is <unk>
This is sort about with many many many different individuals with many different images, different different images, these different <unk> always with a similar result.
The difference between you to see is an image and imagine to see that same image itself.
Now, let me just share with you with you another one other experiment. This is a <unk> lab of Jack <unk> <unk>
They were able to convert the brain waves into <unk> visual <unk>
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed in the people hundreds of the people hundreds of hours of the YouTube videos of YouTube hours of YouTube hours of YouTube hours of YouTube hours of YouTube hours of YouTube hours of YouTube hours of YouTube hours of YouTube hours of YouTube hours of YouTube hours of YouTube hours of YouTube hours of YouTube hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of
Then I showed you a film to film with new images, new new people, new people, new -- new animals, and as they <unk> a new <unk> again.
The computer, using just the brain information kind of brain brain <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to show what it appeared that the person was looking at.
And on the right one you can actually see is the the computer <unk> <unk> and on the left, the video that is shown to you.
And this is like this is us <unk> out.
We're all very close to do that.
We just need to do we need to improve the way to the same way.
And now, remember that when you sees an image and when you imagine that same picture, you thought about the brain the same <unk> brain.
This is a larger brain scan brain systems available today, and their resolution of a thousand times a thousand times a thousand times a thousand times a thousand times a thousand times as a thousand times a thousand times of a thousand times a thousand times a thousand times of a thousand times a thousand times a thousand times of a thousand times a thousand times a thousand times a
We now need to increase the resolution a thousand times a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you <unk> it?
There are many many great techniques to do that.
One is open to you open the <unk> and put it on the way up.
I just don't offer you for that.
A lot of new people are proposing new techniques of projection for images, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> recent MRI <unk> we first got to ask the next, the next, this technology is going to be next, next to the time.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way is to get greater resolution of the greater big <unk> way to get greater resolution of the greater big <unk> way to get greater resolution of the greater big <unk> way to get greater resolution of the greater big <unk> way to get greater resolution of the greater big <unk> way to get greater resolution of the greater big <unk> way to
I propose this idea idea, instead of instead of grow bigger <unk> make better be better magnets.
We can create a lot more complex structures in a slightly different <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And why does this this matter? matter?
In the last few years, a lot of great amount of effort effort in the MRI <unk> were doing really big, big <unk>
However, most of recent advances in recent advances in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant solutions and brilliant <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In turn, instead of a magnetic field magnetic field of magnetic magnetic field, we <unk> magnetic magnetic muscle patterns <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So by the combining magnetic patterns magnetic strands with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic patterns with magnetic
Also, we can then then split up in the layers growing up growing up into the structure of brain structure of brain brain and brain structure to create the increase in the thousands of us need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure is not only be only the blood fluid <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Will we be able to bring to <unk> our ideas directly directly to the digital media.
Can you imagine if we could actually go through top above the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk> for?
And how do we learn to deal with way to deal with the truths of human thought <unk> <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool for <unk> we kind to amplify the <unk>
Certainly, this same tool could lead is going to take the cure cure Alzheimer's disease and the similar diseases.
We have a few more choices more choices to open up this door.
So anyway, you choose a year a year is going to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it take much much more much more.
We have to learn how to give this step this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to this night about go out of the closet, <unk> and not not just gay <unk>
I think we all have all <unk> <unk>
It is probably going to tell you some person for the first time you love it or tell someone who's a pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer has cancer is cancer, or say to someone who have cancer is cancer -- or say to someone who have cancer is cancer -- or say to someone who have cancer is cancer -- or say to someone who have cancer is
And everything is a really hard conversation, and our issues can actually vary <unk> <unk> the experience of I've ever lived in, and have the experience that I've experienced have been lived in, and have the experience that I've experienced have been lived in, and have the experience that I've experienced have been lived in, and have the experience that I've experienced have been lived in, and have the experience
It's not like that, and must happen. us.
A lot of years ago, I was ago, I was ago, I was working in the South Side of <unk> <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, there I had to go through several number of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I'm going to be <unk> the slope that for my <unk> <unk> short <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I was a little bit <unk> I would a kid -- -- -- a kid -- -- -- like a kid or <unk> a child.
And he would light would appear an uncomfortable silence on the table.
I was going to get my jaw a little bit closer, I would take my coffee at one <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother tossed a cold little look look at his son.
But I would not say anything else, and <unk> it inside.
And I got to come up to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child for three and 10 years, 10 years, I was ready to to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling of terrible feeling of it.
So I promised me the next time I would say something.
So I should have that hard conversation.
So then after a few weeks, a few few weeks, a few few weeks, happened.
"You're a boy or a <unk> <unk>
A family silence a family silence -- but this time was I was going to come up full full full of the women's issues on the table.   -- had the quotes of Betty quotes for?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues," <unk> <unk>
So I would just go back down through and down, and go down my look down and my backs back up, a young girl in four years of a four years of a four years old -- with a little <unk> rose on a challenge for a <unk> <unk> challenge for a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> looking at what a challenge for a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> really is a
So I would just breathe again, again, I got away from me from <unk> close to her, it, and I said, "Hey, know this is something <unk>
I have a short hair short bit short like one guy like the one of a little little kid, and look at a little little girl, you know, like to use you like to use this is you like to use this is you like to use this is you like to use this is you like to use this is you like to use this is you like to
Now, I'm just more about the kind of a kind of girl of a <unk> pajamas. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that little girl looked at <unk> <unk> paying attention attention, and said, "My favorite favorite <unk> <unk> <unk> you have a fish.
You can a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that was all about just -- only do you are you a girl.
What about you with <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was the easiest thing to most easy things ever ever had.
And by the <unk> Because the little girl in the <unk> -- both of us were <unk> <unk> for one with the other.
So as many many of us have lived in a few seconds of them in my life, and often my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the darkness, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how is one how to one feel like how to one feel like how to one feel like how to one feel like how to one feel like how to one feel like how to one feel like how to one feel like how to one feel like how to one feel like how to one feel like how to one feel like how to one feel
That's how much as my life is not different about you or yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you 100 reasons why to come out of my partner was more hard to come out of your own, but get out of your own, but -- but this is hard for us <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me is that you explain to explain to explain to you explain to somebody who have been declared online in a broken bank -- rotates rotates it is more hard to tell that it's been <unk> for.
Who can tell me is that this story is that this story is that this story is that I was telling is is a lot more hard to say to your five five years of five years of five years to get you <unk>
There is no more difficult thing hard, hard, there's only one is going to just exist.
We should stop to stop the way that is hard about to the other one person to make us feel better or better feel better or better feel better or better feel better and better feel empathy because we all live in.
At some point in our lives, we are all living in <unk> <unk> and they can make them feel a sense to make it feel security, or less security than the other side side of the door.
But I'm here to tell tell you, is that that no matter what are they made of your walls, a country is made of your walls, a country is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine themselves 20 years ago.
I, I, that I had a horse on a horse, horse it, a horse, a horse horse, a horse called a horse horse, a horse horse, a horse horse, a horse called a horse horse, a horse horse, a horse called a horse horse, a horse horse, a horse horse, a horse called a horse horse, a horse horse, a horse called a horse horse, a horse horse, a horse
It was not the militant lesbian lesbian prepared to fight anything about any <unk> four years of four years of four years in my coffee.
It was a <unk> been frozen about <unk> on one corner of my dark <unk> <unk> <unk> my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> just one muscle is that I've ever done. done.
My family's friends, full <unk> <unk> that I've spent my whole life in my life trying to not <unk> -- and now now have a whole world turn around, and now and now have a whole world turn around.
I was just burning off the pages of an script script of all of us have been followed by the time, but but if you not toss out that <unk> <unk>
One of my <unk> <unk> more memorable grenade grades <unk> on my wedding wedding.
It was the first time that many many people were invited to know this was gay, and was to do my baby <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And after I talk to a moment, one of the women decided to <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the gay story battle of the gay story was the gay story had started.
Did you ever have a ever <unk> <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have a friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but but have heard it <unk>
<unk> meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and have never talked to <unk>
Do you know what is your <unk> TV show <unk> program.
Our program <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And you know who are we going to go on with you.
Jack is a <unk> <unk>
And then one was a woman, you <unk> but just wait desperately for me know that I was on my side side, he finally was on my side side, he finally said, <unk> "Well, sometimes my husband use it?"
And I had a chance at that moment, as the same is all about <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> might have have been really been easy to indicate where they felt about <unk>
It's not very hard to find out, and find the fact that they were <unk> out.
And what else else can you ask for someone, other someone, you can ask for someone, it is <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the same thing you <unk> for.
That's how much as hard conversations are hard to be my own point.
Ask any one that I had ever <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I still follow my way up, to call the three <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
Now, please look at this as through the kind of this through the <unk> perspective, but but understand what is going to come out of all work is essentially be the same thing.
Number one: Be true true true.
Would you know that the armor. self is you yourself.
That little girl in the coffee didn't have <unk> <unk> but had <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you want somebody to get someone to be <unk> to the other <unk> you need to know that we also have to do that we also have to do it too.
Number two: Be right enough, Sean <unk>
If you know what are they gay, you <unk> for you.
If they say to your parents that maybe they be gay, they will will maintain the hope that that might be change.
Don't you give you a false sense of a false sense of a false sense of a false sense of real hope.
And number of all, and more important --  -- let the complex shape.
You communicating their truth.
They will never get care about that.
And some of you can get out out out out out out injured wounded out safe <unk> over what they've ever done, but but feel sorry about what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you have a few of you to have a little little bit <unk> -- but that's that something about you not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, are, but not touch with her.
That's the history of them, but but not about you.
The only story that matters is what you really want to write.
So the next time you can find in a dark <unk> <unk> <unk> you have to know that we have all have all have all have all have all have all have all have all have all have all been there before. before.
And you may feel a very close by themselves, themselves, themselves, are not.
Thank you, <unk> <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> What is that?
If you look at the story of the history of what the intelligence, you can seen the intelligence, a small example has intelligence, you look at the intelligence, a small example has intelligence, you like to see the intelligence, a small example of intelligence, you have seen intelligence, a <unk> quote from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a question of if a machine question is, question of, question if a submarine
When <unk> <unk> <unk> wrote this as it as well as this as a criticism of the computer pioneers of the computer as Alan <unk>
And this is a few years ago, ago, a program program program is trying to understand how to understand how to understand how to understand how to understand how to understand the idea to understand how to understand how to understand how to understand the idea to understand how to understand how to understand how to understand the idea to understand how to understand how to understand how to understand
Let's go back up a step off.
First, let's first start to start with a mental experiment experiment.
Imagine that you're from the Earth for millions, even millions of millions of years.
And you can see a very odd effect of very strange effect.
Of course we <unk> -- know the reason that we are trying to save us ourselves.
We're just trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from of a alien race that you doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept of concept about intelligence of concept about intelligence on Earth, you could to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to develop a physical theory that explain how to the same time in time, the time in time, the time in time, the time in time, the time
And that's why I claim this is the point that this is the point that this is the point that this is the point that this is the point that this is the point that this is the point that this is the point that this is the point that this is the point that this is the point that this is the point that this is the very much
So in this program that I did is do a number several several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science -- through various different disciplines that -- -- I think, is going to a single underlying <unk> mechanism.
In <unk> For example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> carefully for the development of the intelligence of the intelligence, and to the development of universal states that <unk> the possible future <unk>
Finally, on the end with the robotic <unk> <unk> <unk> have been a variety of recent recent techniques that we've tried to harness the skills of robots of robots of robots of robots of robots of robots about robots to do that robots have robots of robots of robots of robots of robots of robots of robots of robots of robots of robots of robots about robots to do to
And by taking all these different kinds of different things and <unk> <unk> together, he -- for many several years ago: There is this an underlying force for the intelligence that we can can extract from all all these different <unk> <unk>
There's only one is just an an an equation for <unk> <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What are you looking at is probably the point the most close to a point and one and <unk> = <unk> <unk>
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is is looking at is a force of maximize the future freedom for action.
It acts to maximize the future future future freedom, freedom freedom action, or keep open up open up open up with open strength, force, the possible future futures future future futures future future future future futures future future future future future futures -- -- future future futures future future future future future future future future future future future future future future future future future future futures -- -- future future
In a few words, to the intelligence don't like to be <unk> yet.
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future future freedom open action maximize maximize the future open.
And in this equation, is natural ask: "What can you do with this?
How <unk> <unk> is?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a picture now a picture that I think, is going to show some of the amazing applications of this particular equation.
Narrator: <unk> research is <unk> <unk> <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that those universes that are more disorder, or <unk> for their life they should have to have a tendency more more favorable conditions more favorable to conditions more favorable to the existence of smart things like us.
But what is what happens if that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What if intelligent happens if intelligent is what happens if intelligent is smart if intelligent is smart if is intelligent if intelligent is smart if is intelligent happens if intelligent is smart if intelligent is smart if is intelligent if intelligent is smart if is intelligent happens if intelligent is smart if intelligent happens if intelligent is intelligent if is intelligent if intelligent behavior is not only about with the
To find out, we have developed a software engine called -- designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy long-term condition that you can find out there.
<unk> <unk> could be spending multiple evidence of animal tests -- animal games, -- to play a human <unk> play a human <unk> play with human <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here are some some examples of <unk> <unk> <unk>
Like a <unk> <unk> we see <unk> <unk> <unk> -- automatically a pole for a <unk>
This is remarkable in part part because we never gave it to the <unk> goal.
He just decided it for its balance <unk> <unk>
This <unk> ability to balance is have applications for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is the ability to use tools of tools is going to have use tools use tools that we can use tools of tools that we can use tools of tools of tools we are using applications in the way of the tools will be used applications in the way in smart manufacturing and clinical manufacturing.
In addition, the same as some other animals can actually cooperate cooperate -- from extreme opposite opposite of them from a single time to release the food, you see <unk> -- can be able to figure out, you can do a version version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation is cooperation you have interesting consequences for economic planning, and economic planning. It is a variety of other other different fields.
<unk> it's widely applicable at a variety of <unk> <unk>
For example, here we see successfully successfully see successfully play successfully play with a <unk> game, <unk> <unk> its potential for the game.
Here we look at <unk> <unk> new connections into a social network where our friends are constantly <unk> <unk> and maintain the very good network.
This is same same capacity of network network network network network network network also is also <unk> applications in health care care about it.
Here we look at <unk> <unk> organize the routes in a mammalian fleet fleet of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and using the Panama Canal in order to be able from the way from the Atlantic to the Atlantic.
In the same way, it <unk> is really widely applicable in trouble problems in defense for the same way, -- <unk> it's widely applicable in trouble in trouble in defense -- in defense -- and transportation.
Finally, we see here to <unk> spontaneously discover and run a <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> actions, successfully increase active assets under their exponentially.
This is this risk of risk management risk is going to have large risk management management large <unk> <unk>
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of different cognitive cognitive behaviors brands -- cognitive human behaviors are possible cognitive behaviors -- cognitive behaviors -- cognitive cognitive behaviors -- -- cognitive cognitive behaviors -- -- cognitive cognitive behaviors -- -- cognitive cognitive behaviors are possible cognitive cognitive behaviors -- -- cognitive cognitive behaviors -- -- cognitive cognitive behaviors are possible cognitive cognitive behaviors -- -- cognitive cognitive behaviors
Now, here is a profound <unk> <unk>
Let's go back back back to the first use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of
The machines were <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work of this work work is that maybe all have all these decades, decades, have we had all had all the idea of the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's not that the machines first became smart -- and then try and take over the world.
It's the other way the other way that the impulse to take control of all all the future possible is a more fundamental principle that the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise out going to be able to come out directly from taking control right up.
Another important consequence is the important consequence is the search for the target.
You often ask me, what is that you look for targets are <unk> <unk>
My equivalent of that statement is a physical process that is a physical process that is a physical process that is a physical process of a physical process that is trying to to build artificial <unk> artificial intelligence, it is the following: <unk> intelligence must be seen as a physical process that a physical process is a physical process that is a physical process that is a physical process that
Thank you very much.
We are at a point of inflection place in the point in human history, something of the stars and missing stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we have really extended much our knowledge about how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The NASA Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting around other stars, what points that the Earth is the one between the billions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions
Kepler is a Kepler is a Kepler is a Kepler is a Kepler a space telescope is called is a <unk> space telescope that measures the faint <unk> intensity of the stars when the planets go ahead in front of them them, and block a little bit of that light <unk>
The data gathered around by Kepler show the planets in the planets in top of the planets that there are between them and their <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> this is really help us understand if these planets are <unk> <unk> <unk> like the land <unk> of our solar system, our solar system -- of our solar system -- of our solar system, our solar system -- of our solar system, our solar system -- of our solar system, our solar system of our solar system, of our solar system of our solar system, of our
In turn, this gives you clues about what are these planets that we found out are been habitable or don't.
Unfortunately, as we are finding out about this area of potentially <unk> fit in, our own planet the planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
Last year 2014, was the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and sea ice have been to the time for the time for the time for the time for the time for the time for the age of now is now been with us for the time for the time for the time for the age of now is now been with us for the time for the time for the time for the age of now is now about
These are environmental shifts environmental changes have caused by the global scale scale -- quickly our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not not a weather scientist on weather, or <unk>
It is that I study the <unk> on the planet is influenced by the hope to find places in the universe in the universe where to discover life life beyond our planet.
I could just say that I'm looking for a look for alien opportunities for alien opportunities for aliens <unk>
Now, as someone is very interested interested in the search for life life in the universe -- can I tell you that that the more look for the planets that to the Earth, more enjoy the planets like our own planet.
Each one of these new worlds invites you to a comparison between the first <unk> and the planets that we know better -- better than our solar system are.
Let's take our <unk> <unk> <unk> neighbor Mars.
Mars is small <unk> and <unk> and even be a little bit farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable <unk> shown by a mission like <unk>
In fact, that is possible that that Mars have have been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the past and the past and part is that we really studied as much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are tracking them out of the clues about the origins of life as life as we know about.
<unk> of the satellites that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you have samples of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and try to understand how Mars has have to lose <unk>
The private companies are now offered to have only have only be just short short short space flights -- also the possibility of living on on Mars.
But despite all these <unk> images, you remind us us are the good places in our planet, places that are linked in our imagination in our imagination <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> compared to the imagination <unk> <unk> and <unk> compared to the imagination in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> compared to our imagination <unk> <unk> <unk> compared to our imagination <unk> <unk> <unk> compared to the imagination that
Let's take an extension <unk> areas of our planet that are still <unk> <unk> <unk> really <unk> <unk>
Even in the smallest <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> dry places on the Earth the air is fresh -- full of you sticking out of us sticking out of us running away with us moving oxygen bulbs away.
I worry about this thing that this is kind of this kind of excitement of the kind of the excitement of the colonization <unk> of Mars and other planets going to come up with great and sad <unk> <unk> the implication and the belief in some of you that Mars would hope for us to have this order to make this is truly <unk> <unk>
So for a long way I like to <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm deep disagreement deep disagreement in.
There is a lot of good reasons to go to go to go to go to <unk> -- to <unk> humanity is to imagine that the <unk> captain of the Titanic to imagine to imagine that the time that is really going to have to imagine that the time the one to imagine to imagine is that the time that is really going to have to imagine that the the
But the goals for <unk> <unk> are <unk> to <unk> and replace it, it is the land <unk> <unk>
No, they are actually face faces of the same <unk> <unk> <unk> goal of you hope to preserve and improve our life better.
The extreme environments are present in our world world look like <unk> <unk>
They are only found out more close to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep us to create and maintain them <unk> spaces in the hostile areas and the hostile areas and the hostile areas and the hostile areas and the hostile areas and the hostile areas and the hostile areas and <unk> <unk> in the hostile areas and the hostile areas and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe we can satisfy our need to preserve our
I'll leave you with a <unk> experiment <unk> <unk> paradox.
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi did, in the point that our universe has been around for a long long time -- -- and hope that there were many many planets in in this universe, universe, we should have found a lot of planets in this universe in this universe in this universe, we should there are many many planets in this universe in this universe in this universe,
Well, where are they? are from?
Well, a possible solution to the extent of important important people have to protect us with protect the animal <unk>
It is a <unk> <unk> <unk> think that only is only be only <unk> <unk> <unk> only be only <unk> <unk> we got to be able to save us of ourselves of us ourselves, is ourselves, that we are just going to be able to save us of ourselves, ourselves, about ourselves, you of ourselves, are ourselves, from us of ourselves, is ourselves, that we are just going to save
If we really believe in our ability to go to look at the hostile environments of Mars are human <unk> then we should be able to overcome the very much easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I went back home. home.
And while he was on on the front front porch by looking at my pockets, <unk> I noticed that I had no keys.
In fact, I could actually see from the window at the dining room room table, where I had <unk> <unk>
So fast quickly I tried to open up to all open up all all all the other doors and windows and windows, and quickly open up to the whole other other doors and windows, and quickly open up very <unk>
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell own, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long long time to get on, and and make it cold.
I could not go back home with my friend's home home with my friend from my friend from my friend from my friend from my friend from my friend from my friend from my friend from my friend from my friend from my friend from my friend from my friend from my friend from my friend from my friend from my friend from my friend from my friend from my
<unk> expensive, but do you sure not more expensive than one <unk> at the night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, it really was going to even though of the circumstances, it was very well over.
I'm a profession and I know a little bit about how your brain works.
<unk> <unk> <unk> increase heart rhythm, <unk> <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk> <unk>
And when I got to <unk> <unk> <unk> in the airport, I realized that I had no <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to wonder, -- if there was something that I could do is something that I could do is a systems that I could put in place in place -- that we have a bad things that happen.
Or at it at the very little bad things going wrong -- bad things -- would you have a chance to be a total <unk>
So I started to think about that, about that, about one month later on, my thoughts <unk>
I was having dinner with my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I talked about he <unk> the window, and I had forgotten my <unk> little <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> <unk> who had been writing about this is a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what is the <unk>
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts have experts come out wrong, right?
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you look forward and trying to figure out to figure out about all the things that you could going to get out wrong, then try to figure to figure what can you do to do to stop the things that we do to stop the things that we can do to stop the things that we can to do to stop the things
So what I want to talk to you is to you is talk about some of the things that we can do in the form of a <unk> <unk>
Some of them are <unk> <unk> <unk> other ones are not <unk>
I'm going to start with the obvious ones.
In the house, it <unk> a place for the things that you really lost easily.
This sounds common in common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports is this <unk> <unk> based on how our space works.
There is a structure in the brain is called the brain is called is hippocampus, that it has evolved over over thousands of years, to get track the location of the important things that important things are fish -- -- that happens is where the fish are fish -- -- -- that happens is where the fish are fish -- -- that happens is where the fish are fish --
The hippocampus is the part of the brain in the brain <unk> <unk>
It's the part of the brain part of the brain that we can <unk> <unk>
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> <unk> and still find their nuts.
They were not using the smell, but the hippocampus, that really evolved mechanism is very evolved from the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that they don't move much, well for things that they move very much.
This is the reason we lost to lose keys off the car, <unk> <unk> <unk>
So at home you have a <unk> place for the keys, a hook <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
For your <unk> a particular <unk>
For their <unk> one particular <unk>
If you take a place one place and get you to with it that your stuff is always going to always be there when the <unk> were.
What about the <unk>
Take your credit card a picture of your credit cards, out a drive, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you have these things are lost in, or <unk> this can make you <unk> <unk>
These are some more obvious things of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress your brain <unk> <unk>
<unk> is toxic toxic <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So part of a part of <unk> <unk> practice is, is to recognize that that we are going to be able to be at the best time, and have to put the systems in the place.
And there are perhaps more stressful <unk> situation than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in in that situation, we can have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care care about our medical care care to our medical care care about medical care, or want to help them help them with a decision.
And that's why I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very very very very particular medical medical <unk>
But this is kind of as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> decision-making takes a whole lot <unk> <unk> made of financial decisions and make financial decisions and social decisions that you have to take from the that we have to have a rational difference a rational difference in a rational difference a rational difference a rational difference in a rational difference a rational difference in a rational difference a rational
So suppose you're going to go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've received a result of the laboratory results from the laboratory lab, and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk> <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is high cholesterol cholesterol is is associated with is a greater risk of heart disease -- is going to attack the heart, brain <unk>
So you're just thinking that you had to have high cholesterol cholesterol is the best, then the doctor say, <unk> <unk> a drug that you will help you <unk> <unk> <unk>
And maybe you already have heard about <unk> <unk> and knows that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, you even know that you know people to know about them.
So you think, "Yes, you know the <unk>
But there's a question that you have to have to have this is that that most majority of doctors don't want to talk about, and -- and companies even want to talk about.
It's for the <unk> number necessary to <unk>
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people that you have to take a drug a drug or to have surgery on surgery in any medical eye procedure before you help a person.
And you must think about what kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The number is going to be one.
My medical doctor wouldn't tell me -- something if not to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way.
And it's not fault the doctor, blame failure, someone's fault someone's fault someone, of the other scientists like me.
We haven't understood what really well understand the <unk> mechanisms.
But are the estimates estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs is <unk> only about 30 to 50 percent of the drugs just work.
So the number we need to treat the <unk> more widely <unk> what do you think is it?
How many people have to do it take it before you can help a person a person?
300.
This is according to the research of the cynical researchers <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I would explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for one year a year before you avoid just a single heart heart attack, a single heart heart attack, a heart attack, brain stroke or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, are one chance on 300 to get my <unk> out.
Why is not, we <unk> <unk> <unk>
But then you should be asked by the <unk> one more <unk> and it is, we would just stop the <unk> <unk>
For this particular drug particular drug, the side side effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And they include these <unk> <unk> <unk> things <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you think, is five percent is not very likely that I'm going very much going to happen to me happen to me.
But one point of time.
Now remember that low stress is clearly.
So think about how to do it do this is how to do this is how to do this is how do you do this is how to do this is how do you do this is how to do this is how to do this is how do you do this is how to do this is how do we get this to do this is how do we
300 people take the drug, right? A person has to give you five percent of the 300 people have to do is five percent of the 300 people have to do is five percent of the 300 people have to do is five percent of the 300 people have to do is five percent of the 300 people have to do is five percent of the 300 people have to
You have to have a lot more likely to come out of me out the way for the drug help you.
I don't say that they had to do is take the <unk>
I'm just saying that they must have have to have to have this conversation with this conversation with your medical doctor.
The medical ethic is really requires, about is part part of the part of the principle of the principle of informed consent consent informed consent consent informed consent thing.
We have to have a good right to have access to this way to initiate the conversation that we start the conversation about if you want to take the risks out.
You may be thinking that I've launched this is that I've launched this number up in the air because of the crash of crash, you all about trying to try and try is about is pretty much typical.
For the surgery that more is more is done in the most popular men in 50, <unk> <unk> <unk> cancer, the number we needed is <unk>
That's what this is, is this is this is 49 surgeries for a person that has helped been.
And the side effects side effects of side effects side effects on in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the helplessness include or dysfunction dysfunction include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you is lucky enough and is one of that 50 percent is just going to show you a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> <unk> is thinking about before the time is questions that you could do is going to go through the way forward to the way forward.
You don't have to make all make all that make all the way on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you got a lot of a lot of times, they often want a more short life more <unk> for the pain, you had a longer life that might have really have much much much to the <unk>
These are things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and loved their loved ones.
You can just change it in the heat of the time, moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> <unk> <unk> up under stress, and one of the things that happens at right now is that you get a lot lot of systems.
There's a whole evolutionary reason for this. for this.
We Face a face with a predatory way, with a predatory <unk> you don't have need to do is that we need a <unk> system or <unk> or <unk> or your immune system -- or your immune system -- or the <unk> immune system -- -- because if the body is spending spending in those things that it doesn't really much quickly.
Unfortunately, one of the things that you go through the window during those stress moments of stress is logical <unk> <unk> <unk> as Danny <unk> <unk> <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to have to focus them to think about the future to this particular way.
I think the important thing here is to to know that we are all <unk> <unk>
We're all all going to have time in time.
The idea is to think about the future how to those <unk> are <unk> <unk> to put the systems in the systems that will help to minimize the damage, you want to minimize the damage, you have bad guys in the first place.
We went back up to the night of snow in <unk> <unk> <unk> when I went back from my journey, my journey, my contractor trip, my contractor set up a <unk> <unk> <unk> key way to remember that.
And I have to admit that I still have got a lot of lots of lots of a lot of a bunch of letters that I haven't ordered -- and lots of lots of email messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not a very <unk> but but I see the organization <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It means <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you're just playing a <unk> musical instrument and see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play <unk> <unk>
Two <unk> <unk> <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing from a <unk> tree of <unk> <unk> you can see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and many thousands and thousands of <unk> you can ever be <unk> at a complete silence.
That's my current current <unk> of <unk> a very dark sound of <unk> <unk>
I'd like to share a little bit bit about story about the story of the history of the American American <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- besides a little bit of my own story.
The French signs of French signs came up in the decade in 1800, 1800s, went up in time, close with local tags, <unk> <unk> <unk> language today is how to be <unk> today.
So this is a story about 200 200 years now.
I was born in <unk> and was to believe that sound was a part of my life.
And I thought it was really true.
However, I now just realize it's not true for anything.
<unk> are a very important part of my life in my mind, every day.
As a sound <unk> <unk> who is living in a sound <unk> <unk> <unk> if I lived on in a foreign country, following the way to their rules, <unk> <unk> <unk> behaviors and norms, <unk>
So how do the sound understand that?
Well, I look at how people behave behave and respond to sound.
People are like my little speakers and <unk> <unk> sound.
<unk> and make it <unk>
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds sound, and have seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, -- for example ...
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't you do a lot to a lot to a lot to a lot of a lot to a lot of a lot to a lot of a lot to a lot of a lot to a lot of a lot to a lot of a lot to a lot of a lot to a lot of a lot to a lot of a lot to a lot of a
"Not <unk> <unk> and when you're eating sure that <unk> <unk>
All this is <unk> <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag sound of sound of what the average person does.
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound <unk> the sound is the way to come next.
Hence this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
It's going to keep going on.
<unk> <unk>
You can see the <unk> you have no notes in the lines.
That's why the lines have already contain sounds through the sounds through the <unk> subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> <unk> <unk> movement is equivalent to the sound.
This is the signal <unk> <unk> <unk>
A typical typical <unk> have five typical <unk>
However, to me, do is what do be it with my thumb with my thumb -- so it's not just natural.
That's why in my drawings just just got four lines in the paper.
In the year 2008, I had a chance to travel to travel to Berlin, for an artistic <unk>
Before the time before this time, it was working on like <unk>
During this summer, I have museums and spaces of different <unk> <unk> <unk> and while I went from one place to another another, I realized that there was no visual art art in visual art in there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend -- and that is what I was <unk> <unk>
There was no visual art in visual art, all the whole thing was hearing.
Now sound in the sound come in into my territory of art.
Is it going to me more about art?
I realized it's not about what it is going to be.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know how well that do only do only do only do only do you just do with just experience through the <unk>
I can feel it in a <unk> way, or experience it visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound property of sound ownership and <unk> <unk> in my artistic <unk>
And all the other things I had taught me in the sound sound, the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk> it.
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, the art community, I was just described with the amount of support and support that I got.
I realized sound sound like money, money -- power, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In my background in my mind, my mind, I always felt like the sound was <unk> <unk> was something about a <unk> person.
And sound is so powerful that you can well go back up to me and my artistic job, <unk>
I chose to give you <unk>
There is there's a massive culture around the language is speech about language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice in my literal literal voice literal way to communicate, the eyes of society is what if you didn't have a voice at at all.
So I have to have to work to work to support yourself as well as well as and as much as and to the same way.
So that's what I'm going to be relevant about being relevant relevant to be relevant relevant about.
So in school, the work and institutions, work with many many different performers <unk> <unk>
And his voice is a voice to a voice and voice and identity.
They help me to be <unk> <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, I'll ask the <unk> their voices, am voices, be able to hold a way a way of a kind of kind of a time form of a kind of kind of a time form of a kind of kind of a time form of kind of a kind of kind of a time form of a kind of kind of a time form of kind of a kind of
If I will not continue to go through with this practice practice, I was going to look at the <unk> and not have any kind of the social value.
So with sound sound like my beautiful <unk> new artistic <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was very surprised by seeing the similarities between the music and <unk>
For example, a musical note that you can't capture it, and completely express and express that and fully express and express it.
And the same thing can is mean of a concept in <unk> <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> <unk> what that means is that subtle subtle changes can can affect all affect the same way that much of the signals like the signals as like of the signals as the signals like of the signals as much of the signals as much of the signals as much.
I'd like to share with you with you with share with you with share with you with you with share with you with share with you with you with share with you with you with share with you with share with you with you with share with you with share with you with you with share with you with you with share with you with you with share with you
So imagine a piano.
<unk> divide a lot of many different different <unk> parameters
If you <unk> a <unk> different <unk> <unk> <unk> every day -- is facial expression, facial expression facial expression that facial expression -- facial expression with facial expression that facial expression -- facial expression with facial expression that facial expression -- facial expression with facial expression that facial expression -- facial expression with facial expression that facial expression -- facial expression -- facial expression that facial expression -- facial expression
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> <unk> you need the 10 <unk> <unk> <unk> to express a concept of clear concept or idea <unk> <unk>
If just just change the key key idea, it change the way up, would it create a completely different meaning.
The same thing is happening with music that as to pitch, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was just going to use it in use these different <unk> <unk> you can can use this is different <unk>
So for example, that is the <unk> sign on that."
This is the <unk> signal <unk> <unk>
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk> me.
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk> for?
Ah, <unk>
So I got to think, think, and if I look at the <unk> <unk>
If I had to make it create a sign and get it over and again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is all this -- all know this is all that day.
If we <unk> it and forth -- -- the visually speed, visually <unk> look as a piece of music.
Every day.
I feel that the same thing can be said about <unk> <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all the whole night -- drawing.
And this is me to think about about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel like the third is the third more <unk> <unk> than other other two.
This is what time is expressed do is what time is expressed in the body body to the body can express change in time.
For example, one <unk> <unk> one is a hand, two <unk> is two hands in the front of the body, the body -- body, the future is in front of the body <unk> and the past is on on the front of the body.
So the first example is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> The last one is my favorite, with -- with a very very very very dramatic time and dramatic idea at time, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a piece of music term with a particular <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But when I see the word <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I think automatically automatically <unk> <unk>
Look at <unk> <unk> right, right -- left left.
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can do that with me? with me?
All all with the hands in top.
We're now going to do that as much as much as much in your head as much as much on your head as much on your head as much on your head as much on your head as much on your head as much on your head as much on your head as much on your head as much on your head as much on your head as much in
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The international system as note, is this is a visual tool to help communicate in all all the cultures and the languages in signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this -- is this is this -- is this -- do you do with me again.
And now.
It means <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now, let's just take a third turn, please go back again.
And again.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're going to do the three three together.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Good job. All everyone.
Look at how the three <unk> are very similar. -- all all happen in the head and my chest. <unk> <unk> very different.
It's really amazing to see how is the <unk> <unk> live alive and -- -- just like the music.
However, I was now, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> have no sound sound sound, it automatically is social value.
We have to have to start questioning question what social value defines the <unk> develop their own value <unk> <unk>
And this could be a step a step one step for a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand people to figure out that you don't have to be deaf to learn to <unk> <unk> not that you have to learn how to learn the music.
The <unk> are a rich trove trove trove of, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to tell you to you how to give you to you how to give you to you how to do is you how to give you to you how to give you to you how to give you to you how to give you to you how to give you to you how to give you to you how to give you to you how to give you
And you can never know, can can get up in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, this is me.
As I was a kid, my parents were saying, would say, <unk> do you know what are you <unk> <unk> everything, but you have to <unk>
Freedom means responsibility.
But my imagination was going up going to all all these wonderful things a wonderful place, wonderful places I was all possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of an innocence a one one of an innocence a piece of innocence or a piece of an innocence an innocence a piece of innocence or an innocence a piece of ignorance I have to say, because of the adults are being lied about, to protect us for us about the awful real truth.
By the <unk> I first learned out that the adults are also <unk> -- and that they are not very good at <unk> other people.
The time is country, now I'm an adult and teach the citizens that in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You not have to wait a lot to a lot for my students walking through the beach <unk> <unk> <unk>
So as well as a good citizens, clean up the beaches, and not, it's not drinking alcohol, you not get it. on?
It's sad to say to -- is, but now today are more than 80 percent percent of the ocean oceans contain plastic.
It's a bit <unk> <unk>
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these large plastic bits pieces of them to study it under the microscope, and just study them under the microscope, and the <unk> them and <unk> this information on a way up on a map.
But lasts hard for you, hard to you, is a very expensive and also it's just just use to use those very enormous <unk>
So along with my students, ages of six to 15 years, we would dream about to invent a better way.
We have transformed our tiny little tiny little tiny <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We started to build this <unk> <unk> of work <unk> <unk> <unk> for the very <unk> they also got to go in.
And I'm going to tell you, the kids that they can use electric tools and make electrical tools and safe <unk>
Not exactly.
Let's go back back to plastic.
And we collect the plastic way into the size that we found it in the ocean, that is very small, because it's due to the <unk>
That's what do that.
I'll leave the imagination in my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure it into something that we hope to work.
So we decided instead instead of collect pieces of the plastic bits of plastic, you can just use information about information.
By the use of a robot, robot, we took a picture of this <unk> <unk> children had a lot very much thing about with the robots.
Then we created quickly a little bit quickly what we called "a <unk> <unk>
We are so quickly about building prototypes prototypes that we ended up before a lunch.
And we turn it into a floating robot robot going slowly moving slowly through the water and down the water and down the water and down the water and down the water and down the water and down the water and down the water and down the water and down the water and down the water and down the water and down the water and through the <unk>
We can see you see what are the pieces of plastic floating slowly go slowly through the sensor that, the board on board board board board board board board on board this is image and measure the size of each of each of each of each of each of each of each of each of each of each of each of each of each of each of each of each
<unk> this step step forward a step step forward in a website for inventors called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> hope that someone is going to put it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that we have students see a little <unk> and <unk> <unk> are people trying to solve it right away.
I was able to investigate my own problem with my <unk> <unk> <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very good kids at very good.
You can see the news, you can see the Internet, you see the Internet, the Internet is <unk>
A little kid, maybe less than 10 of 10 years, they cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands in the hands in the way in the world's largest <unk> <unk>
They stayed very surprised because this is the water that we <unk> <unk> is the water where the water will <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can see that the water is brown the water and brown and the oil and oil is also very hard to see about in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> <unk> that it allows you to see what is there in the water.
We built a first prototype one <unk> prototype of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> different <unk> what can help you identify what is there in the water.
We were to bring this prototype prototype up with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that project is this project is this project is that more about solving a local problem problem, a local problem, -- my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity that a sense of creativity to help the other other other kids.
I was able to investigate a problem to <unk> <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I want to go a little bit farther away, perhaps to address a more difficult problem, and close up to me.
I am a half Japanese half Japanese Japanese half Japanese Japanese half the French half French -- and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in in Japan.
It was that <unk> that we started to <unk> giant waves <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
More than 14 people died in an instant.
It also gives the nuclear power <unk> nuclear energy as you know about a nuclear power plant close to water.
And today, according to the reports of a average <unk> 300 tons of still be been leaking from nuclear plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant plant into the nuclear plant plant in the Pacific.
Today, the entire Pacific Pacific Ocean has chicken <unk> <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation radiation <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, you look at the map, map, you seem to be most much most of the most of the the radiation disappeared disappeared disappeared disappeared disappeared disappeared disappeared disappeared disappeared away from the Japanese coast of the Japanese <unk> and most time, it is a certain amount for blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've returned back to <unk> every year since the accident was accident, from the accident and independently <unk> with other scientists, the earth -- -- the ground, the river, the river and we wanted to bring to the kids.
Of course we have the <unk> parents don't <unk> do it.
But every night we went to the center of the <unk> <unk> here is all the kind of the use of different masks on here.
It might seem like that they did seem like that they did seem like that they did seem like that they did seem like that they did seem like that they did seem like that they did seem like that they did seem like that they did seem like that they did seem like that they did seem like that they did seem like that they did seem like that
Along with them we discuss the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do next, later, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And to do this, we created a <unk> <unk> map <unk> <unk> out around the region of nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent real-time data in real time of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And with this -- we were able to know that the radioactive <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> off the top top of the mountain into the mountain <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> estimate of <unk>
But based on this we organized an <unk> we organized training, the closest close to the nuclear central nuclear center have to date.
We can approach us up to a 1.5 miles of the nuclear station, nuclear station, nuclear, the area we were able to the fishermen of the area of the area were found out we were collecting sediments on the <unk> <unk> with the area of the area were found out there <unk> from the area of the area of the area of the area of the area were found out
Here we see here is a <unk> we've been going from a local problem a local problem very local problem a very local problem in a remote problem <unk> <unk>
And it's been very exciting to work in these different different scales technologies open technologies and very simple technologies. technologies.
But at the same time, it's been more and more frustrating and more frustrating because we've only been beginning to measure the damage the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started to try to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap at and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom went so much small as small as small -- we found an industrial installation a <unk> industrial facility in Hong Kong and make it it in the larger space dedicated to social impact set into social impact set into social impact set into social impact set into social impact set into social impact set into social impact set up in the larger space dedicated to social impact
It's in the heart of Hong Hong Hong Hong Kong of Hong Kong and is a place where we can work on with wood -- metal metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of biology biology, biology, is basically basically about all there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can and kids play together.
It's a place where people's dreams of children can the kids in the children can actually become actually with the help in adults, adults, adults can be children again. again.
Students: You <unk> <unk> <unk>
We <unk> <unk> <unk> things like, do we invent the future of <unk> <unk>
For example.
Or can we help in the mobility the advanced population being advanced transforming their standard wheelchair standard standard standard standard standard standard standard standard standard standard standard standard standard standard standard standard up standard up into new <unk>
The plastic, oil and oil is <unk> terrible -- terrible, the worst legacy we could is going to leave our children are <unk>
We can not afford to protect the kids in the awful truth because we need their imagination to make the solutions.
So, I would <unk> <unk> we must prepare the next generation of us to care about the environment the environment and the people, and to really do something something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of thousands of pieces of pieces of pieces of these <unk> pieces of steel, the other one one single silk thing.
One is synthetic <unk> <unk>
One is placed in the environment, the environment, the other one would you have thought about.
One is designed a way for nature, the other one for it.
Miguel <unk> said when he looked at the <unk> <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that is fight for being free.
The <unk> was just a only tool of <unk> <unk>
But are the living things are not <unk> anymore.
They grow.
And in the smallest parts of life, life, the cells, we all took all information that for every cell to work it for the <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, the design has been dominated by <unk> <unk> of the manufacturing and production <unk>
<unk> have dictated a world <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the imagination of designers and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> different functions.
But you're not not <unk> <unk> <unk> material <unk> in nature.
Think about the human skin <unk> an example.
Our facial <unk> <unk> are facial <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The fruits on the back back, are <unk> <unk> <unk> little <unk> <unk>
You mostly acts primarily as filter as filter the other one primarily as barrier, as <unk> -- there is no <unk> <unk>
It's a system that happens is about its functionality through <unk> <unk>
Here is this one is a divided display screen that represents my view of the world <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of every designer and a designer and architect working on between the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> the work is now between <unk> between the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> to working on between the <unk>
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, kind of look at the two <unk> <unk>
My job work, on its most simple level, it is about to bring these two visions of the world in the world, moving away from the assembly in the world, moving away from the assembly in the world, moving away from the assembly back into growth.
You probably ask, now?
Why was not possible this for 10 or five years?
We are living in a very special time in history, a weird time, where we had four traditional disciplines -- that one is <unk> in four disciplines that we had to do -- designers for the tools that we had never had access before.
And at the intersection of these four these four these four of these four these four these four of these four these four of these four of these four of these four field fields, my team and I believed with.
So please know the minds and minds and my hands of my students.
We are designing objects, products, objects, objects, objects, objects, objects, objects, objects, we products, questions, and tools for large scale, like this is this robotic arm with this robotic arm with this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> very much distant <unk> genetically print <unk> <unk> genetically <unk> <unk>
Here we have <unk> <unk> <unk> an old ancient <unk> architecture has created a screen where every sparkle is all about only to model the shape of light and light and heat up through it.
In our next next project, we explore the possibility to create a layer and a <unk> this is for a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a second second made of a single piece -- a second <unk> made of one single piece -- a second <unk> made of a single piece <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> with 3D printing 3D printing picture 3D printing 3D printing 3D printing 3D printing 3D printing printing 3D printing printing printing -- this is printed this layer and 3D <unk> layer of the cells, I'll show you more objects out like that.
This <unk> rigid materials <unk> rigid and soft materials <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is the resolution of a human human hair. <unk>
It's also the resolution of a brain scanner <unk> <unk>
That designers have access to have to design products the way of shape of our bodies -- -- but also is to design products of the form of our bodies -- -- is not only the way of our bodies -- -- is not only the way of our bodies -- -- is not only the way of our bodies -- -- are not only way of shape our bodies,
We've also designed a very acoustic chair, a chair -- very comfortable structural way it absorbs sound.
The Carter teacher, my collaborator, <unk> collaborator, <unk> collaborator, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pattern.
We were going to get this surface of 44 of 44 different properties <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The surface, like in nature, the nature that way, is through the addition to other other material or other <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But it's the nature <unk> <unk>
There's no other parts in nature?
I did not raised in a high Jewish school, but a young boy, my grandmother told me about the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of those people got to come in, and to define very much about what to really care about.
Like she <unk> "In the third day of the <unk> <unk> God would have grow up a <unk> <unk> tree.
For that first one <unk> <unk> there is no be any difference between between trunk, we got leaves and <unk> out.
The whole whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land did is in land grow up grow up grow up grow up grow up grow up grow up grow up grow up to grow trees in.
The Earth created a world is done about the place.
I often wonder, would be design that design would be the design is design if the objects were made of one piece?
<unk> a better state of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we are looking for the <unk> material to <unk> the type of the material that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The most abundant <unk> <unk> <unk> are called <unk> <unk> <unk> 100 million tons of tons of tons of tons of these organisms that like shrimp, shrimp, <unk> and <unk>
We think if we could <unk> <unk> your <unk> <unk> we could have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So that's what we did.
We called it <unk> <unk>   Do you want a lot of lots of plastic husks of shrimp, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were going to look at the whole chemical concentrations have been able to get a whole range of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the light, soft <unk> <unk>
To print the large-scale structures at a big scale, built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot can do is what are the material that the material is going on about the direction and create these structures made out about one single new material three feet of a single new material 3.5 half feet long, 100 <unk> <unk> <unk>
When the pieces are ready to dry up, dry down, you find a way to the contact with <unk>
So why do we continue to do with we keep designing with this <unk> <unk>
The air bubbles that were a a byproduct of the <unk> process was <unk> used to contain <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Together with our collaborators at Harvard at Harvard <unk> <unk> the genetically engineered to capture carbon carbon out of the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to make their transition transition transition <unk> <unk> <unk>
A <unk> <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first life forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and abundant water, and with a little little bit of synthetic biology biology in synthetic biology, have transformed a structure made of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And here is the best two: <unk> of these things that to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It fits for our next exploration exploration of design design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility to create clothes to maintain life for <unk>
To do that, we must master the bacteria and control its <unk> flow.
So as the <unk> <unk> we did our own <unk> table of new life forms created <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So I like to think about synthetic biology -- like to think about synthetic biology -- like <unk> liquid -- metals -- -- are <unk> <unk> new <unk> new biological stuff inside very little small <unk>
This is called <unk> called <unk>
We will actually take our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of stuff of clothes, <unk> <unk>
The first one is <unk> <unk>
It lives in our oceans in our oceans and in the ponds of fresh water. water. water.
And then the second E. E. The bacteria <unk> <unk> in the human genome.
It turns out the light on sugar, the other sugar sugar and produces useful biofuels useful <unk>
But these two <unk> don't come in in nature.
In fact, they actually never <unk> out.
They're here, designed for the first time to have a really have a relationship for a piece of clothes.
Think about it as evolution, is not natural selection, it's natural natural, natural selection, natural, natural selection, it's natural selection, natural, natural selection, natural selection, it's natural selection, natural, natural selection, natural selection, it's natural selection, natural, natural selection, natural selection, it's natural selection, natural, natural selection, natural selection, it's natural selection, natural, natural selection, natural selection, it's natural selection, natural, natural selection, natural selection, it's natural selection, natural selection,
In order to contain these bacteria -- we've created a single channel that you like to <unk> these bacteria and to <unk> <unk>
So then we started to grow up growing up, grow up, grow up to grow up, grow up growing up, grow up to grow up, grow up growing up, grow up growing up to grow up, grow up growing up, grow up growing up, growing up growing up to grow up, grow up growing up, growing up growing up to grow up, grow up growing up, growing up growing up
So if we wanted to more <unk> you more <unk> <unk> <unk> channels.
This is a <unk> <unk> system <unk> <unk> when you stretch away from one end to another one end to other other, it is 60 feet.
This is half a half of the length of the length of a football field of a soccer field <unk> and 10 times more than our very <unk> <unk>
And here it is, as we <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels <unk> with life life inside your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are said, "We are actually say "We're actually say "We are <unk> creatures -- last <unk> <unk>
What if you design is going about if design is <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if we could get to create structures structures on the way.
And if we could create <unk> personal <unk> that we include skin <unk> our skin <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Think of this as a way we edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
So it's always always going to go back to nature.
So now you know a 3D printer printing 3D printer <unk> <unk>
You also know about nature that nature doesn't do this.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for example, it creates a highly sophisticated architecture that was highly sophisticated architecture <unk> <unk>
The manufacturing is not going to come up on top at this <unk>
It does do it by the combination of two materials, two materials, two different <unk> <unk>
One acts like structure, the other is a structure, the other is the glue -- or the <unk> <unk> <unk> those fibers in each other.
And this is happen across the scales.
The silk silk worm first is actually focused on in the environment, environment, it creates a <unk> tension, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, life life, is <unk> <unk> <unk>
In order of better understand how this complex process works, we attach a little bit small into the head of a silk worm the <unk>
We put it into a box with a box with magnetic sensors, magnetic sensors, magnetic sensors, magnetic sensors -- that allow us to create this is to create this is that we create this is that we create this is that we create this is that we create this is that we create this is that we create this is that we create this is that we create this is
However, I put the silk worm in the flat patch -- a flat patch -- not inside a box, we realized that we had a <unk> flat <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts different <unk> <unk> and we've discovered that the way, the shape -- the shape -- the composition, the composition, the structure of <unk> <unk> <unk> directly for the environment.
And often the silk worms were down to the death -- inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and used in the <unk> industry.
We saw really see is how to design these <unk> <unk> we could shape silk <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were <unk> <unk> <unk> and be able to create these things.
So we got this process up to the way up to the way.
We had to have a <unk> robot <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we have place on our place.
We knew the <unk> silk lines were going to go into more dark and dark and dark and <unk> <unk> <unk> we can use a solar road route to the distribution of the light and light and heat in our structure.
So we started to create black holes in and <unk> to block the rays of the rays of rays rays of the light rays and heat, measure the silk silk lines about structure.
We were ready to get the people <unk> for?
We wanted to <unk> <unk> silk worms to a line online.
And after <unk> <unk> four weeks, they were just ready to meet us with us.
We put them very carefully at the bottom the bottom of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life lives again, like us, -- but much, much more short. in.
<unk> Fuller said the tension is great great and integrity, right.
By the <unk> biological silk is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> You give all this entire pavilion <unk>
And in a little two or three weeks, three weeks, we were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in a curious symmetry of the symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route of the silk.
The <unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions in the world.
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If the last design of design is design is design is to make life life life and products around us, to form a two two materials, designers have to bring these two visions in the world.
Which leads us to turn it around, of course, the first beginning.
Here's this one new era of design, design, a new age of creation, it leads to design a design inspired by a design inspired by a design inspired in nature design in nature that is inspired by a design inspired in nature design in nature inspired in nature that is inspired by a design inspired by a design inspired design in nature that is inspired by a design inspired by
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever asked, what to do you want to be about <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they ask you for first <unk>
You can can play it with your fingers.

Now, raise your hand if the question question, "What do you want to do it be <unk>
It does some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I am someone who could never answer the question, what do you want to be about <unk>
The problem was not that I had not have any have any have any of have any of have any have any of have any have any have any of have any have any have any of have any have any of have any have any have any of have any have any of have any have any have any of have any have any of have any have any
In school I liked the English English, <unk> <unk> and the art and developed web websites -- -- also just played the guitar in a punk <unk> gang called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you have heard to talk about us.
And usually I like to try and try and try anyway, and have it spent a long time and energy and energy in in this field.
But with the time this is sense about this is really much sense of, about this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it on.
But then I put up with me for something else, a different different bit different, and got me going to and absorb me and absorb and absorb and absorb me and absorb and absorb me and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And finally, I finally just want to give it on.
But then I would like to find something new and different and different, different thing, and I'd like to get a little way into that.
This pattern was a lot of a lot of great lot of great anxiety for two of two reasons.
The first one was because it was not sure about how it was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to have to choose one thing, for all of all of all of all of my other passions <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Another reason for me that I was so many so much anxiety more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong was something wrong on there was something wrong was something wrong with something that was something wrong with something wrong with something wrong with something wrong with this is something wrong with something wrong with something wrong with this is bad about me not <unk>
I was really worried about fear of engagement, the commitment, or <unk> <unk> or <unk> for my own success.
If you can relate my story and my story -- and all these feelings, you like to ask you something that I'd like to have have had to have have had to have have had to have have have to have have to have have to have have to have have to have have to have have to have have to have have to have have to have I ever
They went back to themselves, where they learned to allocate about the meaning of evil wrong about the meaning of evil wrong about the meaning of bad or <unk> or bad things.
I'm going to tell you where are we going to know where they were going to know where we were going to know where we were going to know where we were going to know where we were going to know where we were going to know where we were going to know where we were going to know where we were going to know where we were going to
Do you first first know what do you want to do you want to be about <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that one is one that nobody really matters what was going to go back at that age.
It's a very naive naive thing to causes nice answers in children children like, to be <unk> <unk> or be <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>
It will just take a <unk> <unk> here.
This question is going to do is us over and again as we are growing up in a different way, <unk> <unk> <unk> at high school students the way they going to go pick in in college.
And at some point, what do you want to be about <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before you take away from the dream. dream. dream.
Why?
Now, if this is really inspire kids to dream about what they might might be, is to dream of all that might be.
In fact, right the other other way wrong on the other thing, because when someone asks you to be, is you not to be able to answer with 20 different things, while adults are able to be <unk> and <unk> and be <unk> <unk>
Do you have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob Bob <unk>   -- and he's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this is <unk> <unk> editor was going in <unk> <unk> <unk> teacher <unk> <unk> <unk>
But most people are not going to not hear about talk about people about people like like this.
All you can all hear is that they have to choose about.
But it's more than that.
The notion of <unk> <unk> is really <unk> <unk> in our culture.
This is this idea of the fate that thing is going to be going for.
But and if you are someone who is not connected connected in this way?
What happens if there are many many different different issues that you actually focused on and many many different things that you want to do?
There is no place for someone that one is one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I'll feel something to be something wrong with one with one with one.
There's nothing bad for you in you.
You is a <unk> <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of many different interest and creative activities.
It's a breath out a <unk> for this is say.
It could be able to help if we divide you in three parts: different <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can also use any other terms of terms that we would <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was the great age was that I was good at, in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
<unk> any term you like to or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a sort of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one with one <unk> identity.
It's easy to look at the <unk> as a limitation or <unk> you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my own website, <unk> ideas on my website, <unk> <unk> is that there are huge strengths to being in this way.
Here we are three unbelievable superpowers <unk> <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation something new in the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> <unk> their shared interest in conjunction data visualization for data visualization -- -- and mathematics and design, design.
<unk> is a company a company that is create <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
To <unk> and Rachel was a single idea of unique idea for its <unk> <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
So there's the new ideas of new ideas.
And they <unk> them with all your background can access a lot of a lot of great amount of these things <unk>
The second second <unk> <unk> <unk> learning is quick.
When we <unk> <unk> we are <unk> <unk> us for something, something, we are going to do it.
We looked at all that we have in our hands.
We are used to be <unk> <unk> <unk> used to be a lot of times in the past, and that means is that we have less fear about proving new things and go out of our comfort. areas.
A lot lot of skills are they <unk> other different disciplines, these other things that we have learned to all every new area that we rarely started from zero up.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> full time and was independent as <unk> <unk>
As a little girl would <unk> <unk> me an incredible ability to develop the muscle on.
Now she is the fastest <unk> <unk>
Before I become a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had to learn the most thin sales sales sales higher sales of the more fine sales of the more fine sales of the more fine sales of the more fine sales of the more fine sales of the more fine sales of the more thin sales of the more thin sales of the more thin sales of the more thin sales of the more thin sales of the more
<unk> I was rarely <unk> a loss of time to do is you like to do at the end we have at the end it <unk>
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, different field in one way that you could not <unk> anymore.
The third <unk> <unk> <unk> adaptability. I mean, the way to we turn into a place that you need to be in a given time.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, other videos, a web pages designer -- web designer, -- sometimes consultant consultant for a Kickstarter, sometimes a <unk> consultant for about Kickstarter, sometimes the teacher, James <unk> <unk>
It's valuable because a good job does.
He is even more valuable because you can take different roles because it can can we take different roles because it can can you take different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> <unk> defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The whole world is really quickly and quickly <unk> <unk> and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can <unk> <unk> to meet the market needs of the market needs to meet the market needs market needs market needs to the market, <unk>
<unk> of quick learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are <unk> -- are very <unk> and three skills that might be missing if they're <unk> to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster them the way themselves.
We have to have some complex problems, <unk> <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers not conventional thinkers do to do that.
Let's say that they are, in your heart <unk> <unk>
<unk> of the belly that knowing what they wanted to be neurosurgeons to be <unk> ...
Don't worry, there's not worry, you have nothing bad at you either.
In fact, some some of the best teams of the best teams of the best teams made me a lot of a a specialist and a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The specialist can can dive deep depth and depth and put in ideas, ideas, ideas ideas, and offers a breadth space to the project.
It's a beautiful <unk>
But we all should all design to design lives and lives and lives <unk> and how we were connected together.
And unfortunately, the <unk> are largely excited about, you to just be more like <unk> <unk>
Once I said this is one thing that you can take away from this talk, I hope to be this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you now is a heart transplant, then you go back at all all the media.
That's where you're going to get the best one.
But for the <unk> in the room, including people that one is one one of them in the last 12 minutes,  -- I say, <unk> with many many many many many different passions.
Keep on by those <unk> <unk> <unk>
We <unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner estate leads us to a more real life and happy lives.
And perhaps most important, we <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> <unk> a woman called <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> And couldn't you remember even even remember even the most basic details in their life.
His doctor was <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> I did not know how to help do, <unk> <unk> but get it to it until that, unfortunately, it was the way up in <unk> ...
After his death, <unk> did a look at kind strange and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What's even more surprising.
If we had to have it have have been living -- have have been living -- have had been living -- have it have have been living if you were to have it was living in live alive today, we would have been alive today, we could not give her more help the people that you have to do -- -- years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> the first patient is getting a diagnosis of a diagnosis that we now called Alzheimer's disease. disease.
From <unk> medicine is a long time.
They've found out <unk> and vaccines to protect ourselves from us of us of us of us of us of us of us of us of us of us of the <unk> many many treatments for <unk> <unk> did a lot of us for a lot many treatments for cancer -- for <unk> <unk> for HIV, it <unk> for <unk> <unk>
But little has progress progress has progress progress has progress made progress progress on in Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of team of the scientists working in finding a cure cure for one decade ago.
So I think about this all all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million people around the world.
But by 2050, it's going to affect 150 million that by the way, include many many of you.
If you expect to live to live out to live up to the age 85 or 85 years, to the possibility of Alzheimer's disease is almost one one of every two two.
In other words, there is the one the probability that you are going to go through their <unk> <unk> <unk> or help care of take care about a friend friend or want to take care with Alzheimer's disease.
Just in the United States, time in the USA, cost costs you cost 200 dollars every year.
One of five percent dollars of medical care care care is spending at Alzheimer's.
Today is the most expensive disease is really expensive -- and <unk> <unk> increase an increased as the generation of <unk> <unk>
It may surprise you, Alzheimer's surprise you, surprise you, is surprising to you, is anything, but Alzheimer's is one one of the major medical challenges of great doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been a relatively little bit bit relatively little to <unk> <unk>
Today, one of the first of the the first of the first 10 causes of death of death all about all all about all about all about the world, Alzheimer's world, Alzheimer's is only really <unk> to cure or cure their development.
We are understanding less Alzheimer's disease that other diseases is because we invested less time and money on itself.
The United States government spends about 10 times more year in the year in the cancer research research in cancer -- despite the fact that it costs us more than Alzheimer's is given us cost us more Alzheimer's disease -- and causes a much more similar number of deaths like like cancer.
The lack of resources of resources are resources due to one more cause more fundamental cause of consciousness.
Because this is what many few people knows, know about, but all all the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a disease, and can we <unk> it.
For most most much most recent part of the last <unk> <unk> years, all of us, scientists, embrace Alzheimer's disease with with aging.
We think about going to get it to get it to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of you aging.
But there's only you look at a picture of a very picture of a small brain a healthy brain is a healthy compared to the time that Alzheimer's disease is to see the real physical damage caused by this disease. disease.
In addition to the trigger a severe <unk> loss of sleep loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain expectancy is life expectancy -- and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> brain <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't really much much about this.
Today we know now that they're made of the protein molecules now about.
You can think of a protein molecule of protein protein protein like a piece of paper it folds as an origami.
There are there you have places in the role that are <unk> <unk>
And when it folds it to these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But sometimes things go out wrong, and some of some of them <unk> <unk> <unk>
This makes a protein of protein protein to be <unk> each each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk> <unk>
That's what we're seeing in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent last 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many very steps, and how to block the block is that you block is -- is complex -- how much to a place a bomb.
You would a wire one wire wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You need to find the right step right up, and then create a drug drug <unk>
Until recently, it is very much much small part of the wires <unk> and expected the best.
But now there is now a a diverse group of people people, -- doctors, biologists, biologists, these are <unk> -- physical <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And together, we have managed to identify a <unk> step a critical step in the process -- now is there a new kind of drugs drugs that they brought down specifically specifically about this way to stop the disease.
Let me show you some some of our last <unk>
No one is out about our lab from our lab yet.
Let's look at a look at a look at what happened to the test is how to test these drugs <unk>
These are the healthy worms off, and you can see what are they <unk>
These worms -- on the other hand, they have a protein molecules, of protein protein protein to <unk> each other from them, them, to each other.
And you can see that they're very clearly sick.
But by the time we got our new drugs to these these these these worms at the early stage, then we see that we are <unk> -- and live a normal life.
This is just a very early initial result of these things like this shows that Alzheimer's disease is this shows that Alzheimer's is that Alzheimer's is that Alzheimer's is sample that Alzheimer's is that Alzheimer's is that Alzheimer's is sample that Alzheimer's is that Alzheimer's is that Alzheimer's shows that Alzheimer's is that Alzheimer's is that Alzheimer's is sample that Alzheimer's is that Alzheimer's is that Alzheimer's shows that Alzheimer's
After <unk> years of <unk> have real hope that can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so is that we get that hope that hope is going to get that hope, <unk> to beat Alzheimer's, we need to get help.
It's not about scientists about the scientists like me, this is to you.
We must <unk> <unk> that Alzheimer's disease is <unk> <unk> that Alzheimer's disease is a disease -- and that if we can do it, we can do it <unk>
In the case of other diseases the patients and their families <unk> <unk> more research and <unk> pressure over governments, drug industry, drug industry.
That was essential to move forward in the way we was going to move forward to the way to move forward in the way to move forward in the way we was going to move forward to the way to move forward in the way to move forward in the way to move forward in the way to move forward in the way to move forward in the way we
Today we see now that same unit unit to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's Alzheimer's disease, you often can't do talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims hidden victims still <unk> caregivers from their loved ones day and <unk> too <unk> to go out and advocate for the way out and advocate to go out and advocate for all and advocate for the change.
So it really is really much about you.
Alzheimer's is not matter in most majority of cases a genetic disease.
The whole world with a brain with a brain with a brain is running at risk.
Today, there are 40 of millions of a million patients like <unk> <unk> that you can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talk to them for them, and to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I was going to take this article in the New York Los York Times, in January of this year.
In love with someone, you do this.
The article is about a custom <unk> study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, the lab, and my own experience experience when we try to try this one one last night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: -- two strangers were going to be done for <unk> to be the way to 36 <unk> <unk> more personal and more personal and more personal in the eyes without talking to the eyes without talking about for four for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> <unk> If you could get you morning to a morning or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you would go at somebody other person?
And we <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Number <unk> <unk> <unk> really tell you with your partner partner to your partner a couple what you like from him or him or it, or she -- -- very much honest for this time, -- and I was very honest for this time, -- and I was very honest for this time, -- and I was very honest for this time, -- and I was very honest for this
When I came across this study, a few years ago, a detail was really called to me the attention, the juicy one was two of the participants had had two people married for six months later and invited all to all the whole whole <unk>
So I was a <unk> thing about this process process of making romantic love love, romantic love, the process that we were also <unk> <unk>
And when I was the time to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly good at, I didn't know.
However, I got to get away with -- --  -- and I think it was a good story, that was a good story, so I would sent to the column in love in love in love -- is going to look a few months later.
That was published in January, now, and now be already <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I guess some of some of you are probably probably ask, they still still yet? together.
And the reason I think is a question to challenge it, this is because I've done this question again one and again over the last seven months.
And that's what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back into the subject.
A week before the paper <unk> was very nervous.
I had been to work in a romantic book in the last years, years, I had to write about writing about my experience in my experience in my experience in romantic love with romantic love experience on my blog.
But this is a blog input a long few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just about my friends friends on Facebook friends -- and I hope that my article in New York New York Times New York Times way.
And that has a lot good burden of attention in a relatively relatively new relationship.
But as I had -- have no idea.
The article was posted on line up on a Friday on Friday at the night, and eventually Saturday, this happened in the traffic my blog.
And then, I had already have been called today today to me me for me with me call me tomorrow today today is Show tomorrow today one particular thing, Show the current morning today: Show <unk> <unk>
In one last month, the article got out over eight million <unk> views, and I was like, to say something, a little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage the trust is writing that is that that is to discover that the first thing is to find out that life is to find out that life <unk> of one has one has been loving about to discover is that that is discover that that is discover that the poor people are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people were to call it or <unk> what did every day for weeks, they all do first the same question: are they going to do first the same question, still together?
In fact, when I was doing this talk, I did was doing a quick search for my email with my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk>
And several people were coming up there.
They were from students and <unk> <unk> <unk> like this.
I was interviewed in radio radio <unk> <unk>
I also gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, go, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk> be?
And I immediately immediately put in red.
So I know what this is part part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international papers, you should expect people to feel comfortable and feel comfortable what about it.
But I was not prepared to do for the <unk> <unk>
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> for your own.
In fact, the New York Times, a <unk> article for San <unk> <unk> <unk> that included experiences of the readers of the readers of the readers the readers of the readers when the readers of the readers the readers of the readers when the readers of the readers the readers of the readers when the readers of the readers when the readers were talking about to the study in these
So, my first urge to all this whole whole whole whole whole whole whole lot of this attention is all this whole is all this whole whole whole whole whole lot of this attention is all all this whole is all this whole whole lot of this attention is all all this whole is all this whole lot of this attention is all all this whole is all this whole
I said not every request that we were both going to do a public <unk>
I was working on TV, and take the requests for pictures of two of us two.
I think I was afraid that I was afraid to become a fear to become a scary fear of become part of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know about what only do have the work work out, it really <unk> is, if I was going to be able to produce love -- is that we have only do is that we are producing <unk> love -- love -- <unk> <unk> just not just be <unk> -- is not only one adventure, but but love for you.
But this was a question that I didn't feel about to answer.
My relationship was just a few few months months, months, I felt, about everything, that people made the wrong question.
How do you know what do you know if we put up to do it together or not, it and also <unk>
If the answer was -- do not do the experience of these 36 <unk> <unk> <unk>
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first first about these questions in this same study in recent years, and there, the goal of researcher was not about to have romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for myself was looking for was looking for was looking for was looking for was looking for was looking for was looking for was looking for was sought to foster solitary students, Randolph, in college students, students using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic sounds like it?
But the study did really work.
The participants were much closer up closer up to do that, we were to do -- several number of them number of the other <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a fast way to create a very fast way of you to create trust and interaction trust between strangers.
They've used by the death market members of the police members of the community, the community. And have they used it the other opposite <unk> <unk> <unk>
The original version of story, the story, which I combining personal questions with four very four minutes of visual contact of visual contact of visual contact of visual contact of visual contact of visual contact of visual contact of visual contact of visual contact of visual contact of visual contact of visual contact of visual contact of visual contact of visual contact of visual contact of visual contact of visual
A few months ago, I was going to have a talk in a little <unk> liberal arts university <unk> <unk> <unk> and got a student coming up to me and me and <unk> <unk> <unk> I tried to encourage the study and didn't work.
He seemed to be <unk> for it.
And I said, you want to say that you want to tell you from the person you <unk> it.
Well, he did do a pause.
I think she only want to be a friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that we have to get a few better know about the best after test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, I <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it is about love.
I stumbled back up with the study for the first time when I was 29, he was 29, and was he was going through very hard <unk>
I'd had that relationship that relationship since I had 20, what was most supposed to all all all all my whole entire entire adult life, my first adult, to all all my entire life, adult life and all all all my entire entire adult life, all my own adult life, all my adult life, and my first life to all all all all my whole whole whole time my whole
So I was <unk> in science. <unk>
And I did all know what I was able to encounter about the science of romantic love, the romantic love, and expect that that could be a certain time is going to have to do it <unk>
I don't know if I first realized this at the moment I thought to do for the book that I was writing -- but in retrospect, it seem to look like <unk>
I thought if I was obsessed with myself with the knowledge about romantic love, romantic love, I have to have to feel as bad as bad as bad as bad as bad as bad as bad as bad as bad as bad as bad as <unk> I used to then.
And all this knowledge has all be useful in one way or another way.
I'm a more patient with love with love, love, love, love, love love with love, love, love love, love, love love, love, love love, love, love, love love, love, love love, love, love love, love, love love, love, love, love love, love, love love, love, love love, love, love love, love, love, love love, love love, love love, love love, love love, love, love, love love, love, love love with
Am I got more trust to demand what we <unk>
But I also can also see see me most clearly see me that that is sometimes more than reasonably close to me.
What I look for love for love is love is love is love for love is love is love for love is love is love is love for love is love for love is love is love for love is love is love is love is love is love for love is love for love is love for love is love is love is love is love is love is
It may be an guarantee that this is the be the deception be the guarantee that people would ask when they wanted to know what are we going to go together.
The story that the media was told about the over the 36 questions for 36 questions that there may be a short <unk>
There may be a way for some ways to make any way of the <unk> <unk> <unk> risk of it, you -- to -- this is a very <unk> <unk> story because fall in love you to feel a <unk> but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it's about the love, we are very willing to accept the short thing to accept the short story to accept about.
The story of the story that is, question, are you still still together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or answer or don't.
So more more than a question is, a question -- do you want to do questions you know who your love is your love, and know it?
How do you want to stay in in love with me when things get into love with it, and how to know when to cut back and <unk> it.
How do you live with uncertainty do with uncertainty you live with uncertainty you do live with uncertainty do live with uncertainty you live with uncertainty you do live with uncertainty do live with uncertainty you live with uncertainty you do live with uncertainty you live with uncertainty you live with uncertainty you do live with uncertainty you live with uncertainty you do live with uncertainty you live with uncertainty
I don't know about the answers to these questions, you questions, but do I think it's a good starting to have a really good at that we have a most <unk> conversation more <unk> about love to love next.
So if you want the short version of my history of my own relationship, is to do a one year ago, a year ago, a known and I apply a study designed for creating romantic love, we create romantic love -- to create the romantic love, we create romantic love, we create romantic love, we create romantic love -- to create romantic love, we create romantic love, we create romantic
But fall in love in love is <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So in the end of my <unk> article <unk> <unk> love not happened.
You <unk> in love in love with love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit bit like to read it right now, not because it's not true, but true, but it was not true but true, but because it was a moment, there was no anything that I was supposed to be.
I didn't think about the many times we would have both been both going to take that decision, and how much do you have to continue to do that choice without knowing before if he was always going to choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have had to have it is enough enough to have it is that it is enough enough to have it is it be enough to have had to have it is enough to be enough to have had to have it and responded to be able to have to have to have to love someone as much kind and kind of kind to
But what I've done, in change, it's going to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what are you going to <unk> -- and what maybe spend my life is looking for is that that myth is really really really going to spend real time.
I want a happy implicit end implicit in the title of my paper -- -- by the way, the only part of the paper that I didn't really did have anticipated.
But what I've got to do is the opportunity for choice to love someone, and love someone, and the hope that he was also going to love, to love, it and is it's a deal with love with love. with love.
Thank you.
I was a <unk> <unk> in a mountain <unk> mountain and sort of a way a <unk> <unk> <unk>
A time -- is New York City New York City time a long time --  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- something that really hit me but really upset about but more on.
I'm going to start to start when when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box of wood, it to a dollar bill a <unk> a pen a pen one and a fork in Colorado.
And I thought some <unk> <unk> or some aliens aliens could found this box box like 500 years later and <unk> how our kind of <unk> ideas -- ideas, for example, how we eat <unk> <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's a great <unk> because here I am, 30 30 years 30 years now, and I'm still doing boxes.
At one time I was in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like to go of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and do <unk> <unk> and all all those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I took a dictionary and took all all the pages and made a sort of a little <unk> <unk> on the style of a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the style of a <unk> <unk> in the style of you <unk> the style of a little <unk> <unk> on the style of a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the style of a <unk> <unk> in the style of the <unk> <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid about bees afraid of the bees and <unk> <unk> to them, -- so I added even more resin on on the canvas, <unk>
Instead, the opposite the opposite is opposite is opposite -- in the opposite the opposite the opposite -- in some way it looks about as a half thousand size, you as do you get a text with text with a <unk>
So I was <unk> <unk> more boxes.
This time, I started adding to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started to draw around the objects, the objects, and I realized my God, I can draw in space.
I can can get a little <unk> drawing just drawing like the way it comes around with a <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects up, and created my own <unk> taxonomy of individuals <unk> <unk>
First of all, you know what are you <unk> what are you going to focus that one idea of you who is going to be able to have an idea.
Then I did a little little bit strange and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the <unk> <unk>
And it was great, because I started to set exhibits and exhibits and exhibits a little bit of money for me to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, you going to go back to <unk>
It was that was great man.
At some time I got interested in human way, I was interested in human way, I became human <unk> <unk> I got interested in the human way, the human <unk> <unk> very drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: <unk> me.
I didn't know, no idea what to do, because the resin was going to kill me. out.
And I was going to the bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use this glass glass.
I started drawing on on the <unk> glass, glass, similar by drawing a window, then another window and other window, and another window, and another window, and I had all come together together that form a three-dimensional shape.
And this really work -- -- -- and do is that we use the <unk>
So I did this for years, years, I did this is very much big, big thing -- that I call <unk>
By the <unk> I was very inspired in great measure in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a painting at the <unk> Museum <unk>
Do you know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture picture.
They say it is a little bit bit ahead ahead of the time.
Okay, the <unk> <unk> this piece up.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long. long.
It's got a face <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's that one is the <unk> of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk> <unk>
There is a cave where all these creatures are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're going out in the world of <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is where things of these animals are <unk> <unk> <unk>
The ocean is composed thousands of thousands of us.
This is a <unk> bird <unk> <unk> <unk>
Billy Graham is on the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Anyway, a <unk> kind of <unk>
It's just coming out of the ocean, of the ocean, and spits out oil in a hand while out of the other hand, you got out there.
Their hands are <unk> <unk> <unk> and it looks a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the Earth and the planet is <unk>
So that's what a <unk> <unk>
It's a bit bit of a story.
That's the hand you <unk> <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, it is the other hand, you have a <unk> kind of like a bird's bird, and spits it <unk>
You also have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Anyway, his tail just turn on turn on by fire a <unk> <unk>
I don't know, why do I do that.
Things that are you going to know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eye of <unk> <unk> terrorists.
They've <unk> them <unk>
They were made in the 1950s 1980s, they were baseball baseball baseball cards of the terrorists.
Very little <unk> for your time.   -- this is me for my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> <unk> one is <unk> <unk>
This is about a six six years of years to make 100 of these human beings.
Each is each one is a kind of a kind of our culture, through the media and material <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But every other acts as a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind
They are like cells, they come together, are <unk> out.
And you can walk up with each other way.
Each one is basically a <unk> <unk> a microscope that weighs a pounds 1.3 thousand pounds with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a little little <unk> on the chest.
That's the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm going to show you for the rest of the body <unk> -- there's a waterfall is coming out out of your chest, back, and cover the penis penis or <unk> <unk> <unk> or whatever they have a kind of <unk> <unk>
It's a quick quick review of these works because I can't <unk> it for a long long time.
We got layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> game cut in half.
This is this one has two heads heads, and are communicating on between the two.
There's a lot of pills pills you go out go out there and go into the head of this bizarre bag.
There's this one little <unk> place inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you have <unk> <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
It brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> <unk> It's called <unk> <unk> <unk>
Within this box here, there is a box there is a box there is a box there is a box there is a box there is a box there is a box there is a box, there is a box there is a box there there is a box there is a box there is a box there is a box there is a box there is a box there
We were going to look at the box and all the people in inside hits one other way up to each other?
And I think that's the way to change the world change the world.
When you <unk> <unk> who is you and the box that it's living on.
And together we get together to realize that we are all all about in this way, that this is that this illusion that we are different, different, these concepts of countries of the countries the other countries, the countries of the countries of the countries the other countries, the countries of the countries of the countries of the countries of the countries the other countries, the countries of the countries
We are all all very facts about the same matter matter and in the same box.
And if we just not start to exchange those things up with sweet up, we are all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when they do when it hurts your head?
They will take a <unk> <unk>
But for this pill to have the pain, it first is one for the stomach, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You will take a pill <unk> the most effective system and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially about HIV patients.
When you take to take drugs drugs have these serve the amount of viruses in the virus in your virus in the blood, in your blood -- in your virus in the blood, in your blood -- in the blood -- in the blood -- in the blood -- in the blood -- in the blood -- in your blood -- in your blood -- in your blood, and increase
But they also are also known by their side side effects <unk> <unk> <unk> in its most majority of them negative up to the time you got to come to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and worse for the time it takes to get it to the time it takes to get it to the time it takes to get it to the time it takes to get to the
These are regions of the body regions of the body as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> system, the virus is <unk> -- and not easily go easily at the same way in the blood stream of the virus is <unk> -- and not easily go easily at the very easily go easily on in the way that virus is <unk> -- and not easily go easily at the very easily go
However, after the disruption of treatment, the treatment is treatment can wake up, infect new <unk>
This is the great problem of the HIV treatment treatment with current drugs that is a life treatment for life <unk>
One day, I sat down up, and I think, <unk> <unk> do you get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
As well as a scientific school <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> was in front of me, <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you used to be used in <unk> for the care care care care of the wounds of wounds and diabetes diabetes, can they be used for anything that we have to do -- -- for any anything that we would <unk> including <unk> <unk>
In fact, we're already using pulses pulses of laser pulses and open up or drill extremely <unk> extremely close and close up the cells infected with HIV <unk>
The best people are asked, like, "How is that we <unk>
We sent a little bit very very very powerful short ray short ray laser beam over the HIV infected cell membrane that infected cells are embedded in a way of a liquid <unk>
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell has cell absorbs drug <unk> <unk>
Before you even know that, the question, the hole is <unk> <unk>
We're now testing this technology in in vitro <unk> <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body. body.
"How is that <unk> <unk> you can <unk>
Well, the answer is is, through a three three heads.
With the first head, the first <unk> that's our laser, is going to do is a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second <unk> <unk> <unk> a camera, is going to the point of the infection.
And finally, the third third <unk> -- a <unk> <unk> <unk> the drug, is going directly straight down into the site of the infection, while the laser used again again again to maintain the open cells.
Well, this is not just look a lot very much.
But one day, if you is successful, this technology can lead to the total <unk> of total of the HIV <unk>
Yeah. A cure cure HIV.
This is a dream of all all of all of all of all of all of us of the <unk> <unk> are <unk> in our case, a result of laser <unk>
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied with armed groups, armed groups are armed with armed groups <unk> <unk> out armed with armed groups armed <unk> <unk> <unk> out armed with armed organizations, they were armed with armed armed armed groups, <unk> armed groups, <unk> armed <unk> they were armed with armed armed groups, <unk> armed <unk> organizations who were armed in armed with armed armed groups armed <unk> <unk> armed
<unk> what are these groups that these groups do when these groups are when they're not <unk> out.
And my goal is to be better at better understand that better be better understand that better be better at these these <unk> agents of these viruses charged of these <unk> generators viruses and studying how is transition to transition transition from violent <unk> <unk>
I make a field work in field work in field, in politics and politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups are key together is to solve -- really solve most conflict in the whole conflict in the whole conflict in the whole conflict in the whole conflict in the whole conflict in the whole conflict in the whole conflict in the whole conflict in the whole conflict in the whole conflict in the whole conflict in the whole conflict in the whole conflict in the whole conflict
It used to be an <unk> <unk>
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between between the states and actors.
For example, of the <unk> arrangements of <unk> <unk> <unk> each other <unk> and 2011, <unk> were to signed up between a state and an actor. <unk>
So we should have to understand this <unk> <unk> we have to be <unk> or encourage you in any time current resolution of successful success.
But how do we do to do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reason why do they do it, -- but no one look at what do they do when they do when they do when do they do when they do when do they do when do they do when they do when they do when do they do when they do when they do when do they do when they do when they do when do
The armed <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can not understand these these <unk> <unk> not much less <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> groups of these are complex organizations with complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> we are <unk> <unk>
From their creation in the 1950s <unk> <unk> has also set a political party set into a political party set into a political party -- a political party set in, a political party set in, a political party set into a political party set into a political party set political party -- a political party set into a political party set into a political party -- a political party set
Likewise, the Palestinian <unk> known by its suicide suicide attacks against Israel, also the <unk> in Gaza in Gaza <unk>
So these groups do more than just to fire. fire.
They're so multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking teacher.
<unk> a complex <unk> machinery of communication communication -- communication -- communication -- communication -- TV -- TV and web web web web web web and research web web and web networks.
And here is the <unk> magazine printed in English English and published to <unk>
Too armed groups are armed armed groups armed in armed armed groups, armed groups they also also invest in a complex <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are key <unk>
They will allow them to allow these these groups to increase their strength, strength, rise up better and build their brand. for.
They're armed armed groups armed groups also also also create more strong ties to make stronger ties to invest in social services.
They build a schools, they run hospitals, put in train <unk> professional training programs in <unk> training programs.
<unk> offers all all all of these services <unk>
armed groups are also going to conquer the population conquer to the population of the population, offering something something that the state is not sure about conquer to conquer the way conquer to the population of us, people to conquer the population the population of the state that the state is not sure about conquer to conquer the way to conquer the population to offer something something that the state
The <unk> rise rise rise rise rise rise to rise in the Taliban <unk> <unk> <unk> war or even the beginning of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> can also be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to see it also look at the efforts from these groups for delivering them security.
Unfortunately, the security has one has been going to have a price price for the population.
But in general, they provide social services provide social services in social services, you mean to fill a vacuum <unk> a <unk> gap <unk> <unk> <unk> by the government, and allow these groups to strengthen to strengthen their power.
For example, the election victory is election about <unk> of the Palestinian <unk> <unk> cannot not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
It's a really complex scenario in this way, even in the West, when we looked at the <unk> <unk> <unk> we just think about the violent side side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups of these groups, groups, the strategy or look at the long term.
These groups are <unk> <unk>
<unk> they fill them in gaps that way by the government, and emerge as armed armed and armed groups armed and political <unk> involved in nonviolent struggle in violent fight <unk>
And the more complex and sophisticated are these organizations, we can <unk> -- as something as opposed to a <unk>
How do you call a group <unk> <unk>
It was part in a part of a patch of an territory of its <unk> <unk> you get all its <unk> collect them, collect the trash, they run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a state? It's a <unk> <unk>
Or maybe it's another thing, something again and different.
And what is a <unk> <unk>
The lines are <unk> out.
We are living in a <unk> world in the state world of nations of nations not and hybrids and inject and how much weak the states, are states, the states, the states, the states are states that the states are states, the states are the states, as well as in the Middle East the most <unk> the most <unk> the most <unk> the most actors.
This is important for governments, governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more for the military tools.
<unk> that vacuum of government government <unk> has to be in the middle of any sustainable approach.
This is really important as we also to do that is set out and get the peace.
If you really understand the <unk> <unk> we will understand better how to offer you to offer to foster the transition transition from the transition disease transition from violence to the violence in violence to violence.
In this new <unk> new dispute between states and actors <unk> <unk> the military power is military power <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In order to get these goals very long time we need long-term investments we need long-term investments that we need long-term investments to fill with that block of safety, to fill it that block of government government <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality about gender equality about gender equality <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad.
And I was just going to focus on as a bad feminist.
Or, at least I wrote a paper, a book called "The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bad <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> people start to call the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant meant to myself and <unk> <unk> <unk> has become a big thing.
Let me go back one step back.
When I was young, about all in my youth and 20 years, I had some weird ideas about <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> with men the men and <unk> <unk> <unk>
Today, I see how are women being treated around around the world and the world, and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable response.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using to the <unk> that might be a feminist.
It's going to be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a <unk> taboo and nasty.
And I was <unk> as a woman who is not going to follow the rules out to do too much with high self-esteem and your way up, to believe that it's just like or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> <unk> you to the way up to realize that that is actually that that is actually be that woman and can't imagine him to be a other person.
Over time, as I was growing up, growing up, I started to accept myself that I am, actually <unk> and also really proud to be.
For me, certain claims are women <unk> <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same work.
We have have to have travel right to travel the world as either <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have have to use it to use it very easy to be easy enough and accessible to contraceptives change them, services.
We have a right to decide about our bodies, without <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>
We have the right right to respect.
There you have more.
When you talk about the needs of the needs women, you have to have to have the other <unk> <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people who with a different body, expression of <unk> <unk> <unk> social condition -- -- and much more.
We have to have to look at account that are these differences and how we were going to look at the same way it matters about what we have in common.
Without this <unk> <unk> our feminism is not just nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm full full <unk>
There's a lot lot of things that they make a bad feminist.
I have another other confession.
When I drive up to the work, I hear rap music that all volume.
Even though the letter <unk> <unk> women and offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is amazing.

Think about that.

The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable it becomes economically vulnerable it becomes economically vulnerable in the way through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women become economically vulnerable when they born.

It also happens to the following: As I feel a lot much pressure.
We got this <unk> tendency to put <unk> <unk> <unk>
We hope that to do it really do it really do it really be <unk> for perfection.
When we were to <unk> them with a lot very taste of same <unk> <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> because I was going to get myself out of me about myself with myself <unk> you from that <unk> before I try to try and put up there.

We were also fighting for a very much, long way we wanted a lot, we really need to do -- really need a lot very much.
We're going to go very much beyond the sensible criticism of the sensible criticism are sane and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of any woman, <unk> <unk> until it is not left.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or most good about is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But what happens next? next?
We went to get out of our <unk> <unk> to the day, go to the action and be a little bit <unk>
If I hear music music to you, -- are you going to create a demand for artists that they would be more happy about providing a potential supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women talking about women in their songs until <unk> <unk> change in change that change is actually affecting their profit.
It certainly is hard.
Why has your music have their music have that <unk> <unk>
It's hard to pick up better and easy to justify a better choice.
But when the bad decisions is to justify this that it is more difficult for women to achieve equality, gender equality we all deserve -- and is our responsibility.
I think about my <unk> three and four years.
These are two little <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and bright and also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I want to grow it grow into a world a world.
They were excited about by the strong creatures that they are.
I think about all -- all the time, the best <unk> would kind about is much easier to do.
We can all all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television show is about the sexual violence in the women as sport, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio radio radio <unk> when we heard about songs that women are trying to like nothing.
We can spend our money to go into the cinema place another part when movies are movies about to women than like <unk> <unk>
We can just stop ourselves in support sports sports where the athletes are dealing with their partners as <unk> <unk> <unk>
In any case, men, white men heterosexual men white men are saying, "No, I'm not going to go to a post in his magazine magazine, work with you, until you don't have a number enough of the women were going to be able to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with work with you with you until their <unk> <unk> a more <unk> range of people people."
Those of those of us who are <unk> but got to participate in part of these them to be even more as far as far as to get overcome overcome overcome by overcome by overcome by overcome overcome overcome overcome overcome overcome overcome overcome overcoming to the barriers to the <unk>
Because we're not a <unk> <unk> <unk> no good at these <unk> efforts, not having to adopt these <unk> <unk> our achievements are all <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can make these little <unk> acts of bravery you and hope that our decisions are going to come up to the top, to people in the power directors and producers and producers that they can make big decisions and make big decisions decisions, to create a lasting change and significant change.
We can also claim with our bravery for our bravery -- good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my <unk> book <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> be a bad feminist thing to not be in <unk>
This is true because for many many many reasons, but many reasons, but because of all, my voice was <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
There was a incident.
I would call it an incident incident in front of what happened.
A few guys were excited about when I was very young, old, and I didn't know that guys can do this for a girl.
They were treated as though it was a way out.
I started to believe it was not nothing.
<unk> my voice, and then think about me believe that I could say something might really matter.
But I was just writing.
And that's what I went back back to <unk>
I would just focus on in a stronger version of myself.
And I read the words of the women that they could actually understand a story like mine, and of the women that they looked like to me and understand what was living in live in live in the world.
I read the words of the women that they showed me that was not nothing.
I learned to write about how to write like to write about how to write like to write about how to write like to write about writing like how to write like writing as myself.
I found my voice -- again, and I started to believe that my voice is a voice to think that my voice is voice to think that my voice is voice to think that my voice is voice to think that my voice is voice to think that my voice is voice to think that my voice is voice to think that my voice is voice to think that my
Through the writing and work that if was a little brave, another woman could <unk> you guys and see that no one that none of us is all about is nothing that the one is all about that is nothing that the world is all about is anything that the one is all about is all that the world is all about is nothing that the one is all about
In one hand, I got the power to do anything anything.
And on the other one, I actually argue the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to make a better way to think about, -- and what do I say and do is leaving all what is human in me.
I hope we all can all all do the same thing.
I hope we all can all be a little bit courageous, when more it needs such a courage.
Right after Christmas last year, I was in last year, <unk> <unk> children in California had visited <unk> <unk> <unk> or for being the exposed people exposed to me or for being exposed at the <unk>

There is this one is a <unk> vaccine against this is for about this is much half a century ago, but many of the kids involved in the <unk> <unk> <unk> were involved in the <unk> <unk> because their parents were afraid of because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to <unk>
But a moment, it was not the <unk> article that sparked the argument about autism and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It doesn't think most of most majority of intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism cause autism
I think most most people knows, know it, but millions of people all around the world are still <unk> <unk> that vaccines will put in put in danger to their children having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of estimates of the increase last autism in time.
For most much most part of the 20th century, 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few few psychologists and remember, I had to talk about to create a whole whole professional life without seeing a single case.
Over decades, the estimates of prevalence have prevalence got stable stable cut stable stable to cut stable back to be a only three or four or four kids for every <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk> out.
<unk> of funds as <unk> <unk> <unk> is routinely referred about autism as an epidemic, as if I could <unk> the other child in <unk>
What's going on? on?
If you are not vaccines, are you about it?
If if you ask people in the time of the NASA Disease Disease Control Disease Control what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like phrases as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But that kind of language is that language is a lot long <unk> the fears of a young young man who seeks in the face of his two two years, the <unk> <unk>
If if the diagnostic of the diagnostic is diagnostic had to be <unk> why they were so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why was the cases of autism that hard to find before the age of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to find the answers to these questions.
I learned what happened is to have less than do with is the slow progress and slow <unk> of science that with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
During the most much of the most much of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is -- and how to it was discovered, -- but that story was discovered, -- but that history was discovered, -- but that story was discovered, -- but that story was discovered, -- but that story was discovered, -- but that story was discovered, -- but that story was discovered,
There was a second more accurate story of the autism had ever lost and lost and forgotten and forgotten in dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a infant psychiatrist begins with a infant psychiatrist begins with a kindergarten at hospital Johns Johns Hopkins Johns Hopkins Johns Hopkins Johns Hopkins Hospital <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They could get fun for me for a hours by waving the hands in front of their hands in front of their faces, face, but were to panic at panic for <unk> <unk> <unk> as when you not put their favorite toy into your usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the other patients treated in their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the decade there were primary main authority on the world, in it, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as <unk> <unk> references of places that distant like South Africa.
This is really not wonder, is wonder, because the criteria of <unk> <unk> <unk> diagnosis is autism diagnosis is wonder, because the criteria of <unk> <unk> <unk> diagnosis is autism diagnosis is wonder, because the criteria of <unk> are <unk> for autism diagnosis of autism diagnosis of autism <unk> <unk> <unk>
For example, we have to encourage us to give that diagnosis is <unk> -- will give that diagnosis is <unk> kids out about, the epilepsy is supposed to is that that is very common is very common as in the autism do.
He was once <unk> that he had had to have only nine in 10 kids sent by the other people to being autistic -- not just give a diagnosis diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but it's part of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child and child <unk> caused by cold, cold, cold parents.
And these are these kids, he said, has have have have have have been carefully carefully <unk> on a refrigerator for <unk>
At the same time -- <unk> I noticed a few of their young young young people had special skills to cluster in certain areas like music, the music, the music, math and memory.
One of the kids in the clinic could just distinguish between 18 of 18 <unk> before I was two.
When her mother put one of his favorite records one of his favorite disks <unk> he was right, <unk>
But <unk> I had a bad opinion of these skills of skills, things like how kids were just heard of <unk> what they heard of their parents <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
As as a result of a result, autism became a source source source source of shame shame care for the families, and two generations of people were autistic people were <unk> to be sent out to the institutions for their own own good time, their own good thing, becomes invisible <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, I was not until far until the <unk> theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive psychologist in London, a thought that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was pretty stupid.
She was and her husband was like, warm, warm and <unk> and have a very deep autistic child called <unk> <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as a child <unk> <unk> <unk> support services, without special education, without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National <unk> National Service <unk> families, their families, families, <unk> <unk> and his colleague, Judith <unk> Gould decided to do something that it should have been done is been done about should I have have been done should be.
So they launched a study of prevalence prevalence prevalence in the general population.
I would just take a suburb from London called <unk> <unk> to try and find out find out to find the young kids in the community.
What you saw was just left clear out of clear that the <unk> model was <unk> -- was too limited, limited -- because of the autism reality of autism was very much more diverse and diverse.
Some people could not talk at at all the same way that others were <unk> in their fascination in their fascination in the fascination in their fascination in the fascination in their fascination in their fascination in the fascination in their fascination in the fascination in their fascination in the fascination in their fascination in the fascination in their fascination in the fascination in their fascination in the fascination in
On the other way, these kids would not <unk> <unk> in beautiful <unk> <unk> and <unk> they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> <unk> would have predicted.
At the beginning, they were just lost by trying to make sense a sense of your data.
How would no one have no one of us not realize about these children before?
But then I <unk> a reference to an article on an article out published in a German article published in German <unk> <unk> <unk> the next year to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> under the <unk> <unk> <unk>

The morning morning started with sort of exercises with exercises with music exercises with music exercises with music exercises with music, and the kids were still going to follow their games on the afternoon.
Instead of blame the parents that parents have autism cause autism, <unk> disabled <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Instead of people to treat kids in their clinic way as young patients lucky enough of them the little teachers, and and started to help the development of methods of education systems that were particularly good for them.

<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was a bit wrong that autism was <unk> <unk> as much as the parents were <unk> <unk> for.
In the next few years, they worked out in the silence with the American early early early early time, they worked at the early early early early early days of the <unk> the <unk> of the diagnostic diagnosis that they called <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the late '80s of the '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> limited <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These changes did not spread out broken up broken out. out.
<unk> When we were <unk> and sing out, and Judith worked on the first time to reform it to reform these <unk> people all around the world see an individual autistic for the first time.
Before I came out out out out out of <unk> <unk> -- in 1988, only a small circle, <unk> <unk> <unk> I knew what about the autism, but but after <unk> performance <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, they were introduced the first clinical trials to use for diagnosing autism.
Because I was no longer to have to have a connection with that little circle of one of little <unk> circle of experts a diagnosis of his son.
